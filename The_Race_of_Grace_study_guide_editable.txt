   If you do not know for sure about where you will spend eternity, the first issue for you is to place your faith
alone in Christ alone and receive eternal life.

  Jesus promises, “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has everlasting life” (John 6:47;
NKJV).

   He is most emphatic on this promise: “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in
Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life”
(John 5:24; NKJV).

   The Bible ties His ability to make this promise with His identity as the Son of God: “He who believes in the
Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him" (John 3:36; NKJV).

    Because the reception of everlasting life is conditioned simply on believing in Jesus for this eternal life, the
Bible assures us that it is a gift not conditioned on performance: “For by grace you have been saved through
faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast”
(Ephesians 2:8-9; NASB).

    To believe is simply this: to be convinced that it is true. To believe in Jesus for eternal life is to be
convinced that it is true that He alone is the only one who can give you the gift of eternal life and that He has
given it to you as a result. Eternal life, first and foremost, means that one lives with God forever after this life is
ended. Jesus Christ, who is God come in human flesh, died on the cross as our substitute, bearing the penalty for
our sin. When a person knows they cannot qualify for eternal life through the good works of self-effort or the
rituals of any church or religion, and when a person knows that eternal life comes from believing in Jesus alone
for that life, at that moment they receive eternal life absolutely free. This life can never be lost for any reason.

    If you have received the gift of eternal life through faith alone in Christ alone, then, before you can make
any significant gains in your Bible study, you must be sure that you are in fellowship with God and filled with
the Holy Spirit. The method for such fellowship is simply to follow 1 John 1:9, which is addressed to
believers—believers being defined as “those who believed in Him [Christ] for eternal life (1 Timothy 1:16;
NASB).

   In this manner, both the sins we know about and any other sins we fail to recognize as sin or have forgotten
about may be forgiven and removed as a hindrance to our fellowship with the Lord: “If we [believers] confess
our [known] sins, He [Christ] is faithful and righteous to forgive us our [known] sins and to cleanse us from all
[known and unknown] unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9; NASB).

    Failure to be open and honest in naming and citing our sins means we cannot be transformed by Bible
Doctrine and advance in the faith to spiritual maturity. For this reason, Paul urges brethren, that is, believers,
saying, “Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy
sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world,
but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is
good and acceptable and perfect” (Romans 12:1-2; NASB).

    Such spiritual worship is necessary because “God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in
spirit and truth” (John 4:24; NASB).

                                           The Race of Grace Study Guide
    Welcome to the Free Grace study of The Race of Grace by Marty Cauley. After completing you will have a
clearer grasp of what biblical Free Grace doctrine is versus non-biblical legalism in some of its many forms.
This is a basic introductory work, yet it will challenge you to think as you wrestle with the issues he presents,
issues which so often are confused in the church today.
    As with all studies, the goal is not simply to complete the study; the goal is to learn from the study as you
work through to completion. Learning is never true learning unless you understand what is being taught and
then can repeat what you studied. In this study guide you will often be challenged to do just that.
    The student is strongly urged to review How To Read A Book by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren,
1972. A free PDF copy can be downloaded from the internet, or you can purchase the book on Amazon or
similar sites. Below are ten guidelines from the book. (They are not original with me.) You will find them
helpful.
    Have paper and pencil/pen in hand when you study and follow the ideas listed. Here are ten rules prescribed
by Adler and Van Doren for reading analytically.
    1. YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT KIND OF BOOK YOU ARE READING
    2. In your own words, summarize the theme of the book: STATE THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE BOOK
IN A SINGLE SENTENCE, OR AT MOST A FEW SENTENCES (A SHORT PARAGRAPH).
    3. Outline the book: SET FORTH THE MAJOR PARTS OF THE BOOK, AND SHOW HOW THESE
ARE ORGANIZED INTO A WHOLE, BY BEING ORDERED TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE UNITY
OF THE WHOLE. Do the same for its chapters.
    4. DEFINE THE PROBLEM OR PROBLEMS THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO SOLVE. In your own
words, specify what the author is trying to do.
    5. Highlight key words and phrases denoting the central concepts or ideas of the book: FIND THE
IMPORTANT WORDS AND THROUGH THEM COME TO TERMS WITH THE AUTHOR. Unless you
know his vocabulary and terminology, you will fail to understand the author.
    6. Identify the key sentences containing the central propositions (truth claims) of the book: MARK THE
MOST IMPORTANT SENTENCES IN A BOOK AND DISCOVER THE PROPOSITIONS THEY
CONTAIN. Now express these affirmations in your own words, being faithful to the thought of the author.
Think of examples, real or imaginary.
    7. Summarize, in your own words, the reasons offered in support of the author’s key propositions: LOCATE
OR CONSTRUCT THE BASIC ARGUMENTS IN THE BOOK BY FINDING THEM IN THE
CONNECTION OF SENTENCES. The propositions and arguments constitute the heart of the book. Without
laying them out before you in one place, you will not have a complete picture of what the author is saying.
    8. FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR’S SOLUTIONS ARE. How does the author claim to solve the
problems specified at the beginning of the book?
    9. Be sure you understand before agreeing or disagreeing with the author: YOU MUST BE ABLE TO SAY,
WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY, “I UNDERSTAND,” BEFORE YOU CAN SAY ANY ONE OF THE
FOLLOWING: “I AGREE,” OR “I DISAGREE,” OR “I SUSPEND JUDGMENT.”
    10. Be reasonable: WHEN YOU DISAGREE, DO SO REASONABLY, AND NOT DISPUTATIOUSLY
OR CONTENTIOUSLY. Look for the truth of the thing, not at winning an argument or scoring points.

                                         The Suggested Method of Study
    1. Always start by being in fellowship with the Holy Spirit (1 John 1:9).
    2. Pray and ask for discernment and understanding so that you can increase in spiritual maturity in
       your thinking as a result of this study (Colossians 1:9-12).
    3. Read through the book from beginning to end – Adler and Doren state: “…do not try to
       understand every word or page of a difficult book the first time through. This is the most
       important rule of all; it is the essence of inspectional reading. Do not be afraid to be, or to seem to
       be, superficial. Race through even the hardest book. You will then be prepared to read it well the
       second time” (p. 33).

    4. Read with paper and pen/pencil in hand – make any notes you think are important.
    5. Now go through the book again from the beginning!
    6. Answer the above questions on your paper, 1 – 8 especially, as best you can as you read (some
       will be in this study guide)
    7. As you read, highlight or mark what you perceive to be key points to remember
    8. Complete the study guide as you go through the book the second or, better, the third time!

    Page numbers from the book are given in parenthesis like this (p. 5). Note, when entering answers in the
editable PDF version of this workbook, you can keep adding lines and the font will automatically shrink, when
space for more than one line is intended. Just be certain not to enter so many lines that it shrinks too much!

                                                   Let’s begin

            Table of contents

   Review the Table of Contents and then scan read the book:

    1. Briefly describe what this book is about.




    2. List the chapter headings below and then give a brief overview of what you can expect to learn
       from each chapter. (Again, scan read each chapter to help with this answer.)

        Chapter 1: __________________________________________________________________




        Chapter 2: __________________________________________________________________




        Chapter 3: __________________________________________________________________




        Chapter 4: __________________________________________________________________




        Chapter 5: __________________________________________________________________
Notes                                                                                                     Page 3


    3. In your own words state what biblical problem or problems the author is trying to solve with this
       book:




           Symbols (p. iv) and technical terms (pp. vi-vii)

   (p. iv): Punctiliar means that something happens at a point in time. The author will define the other terms as
he goes but keep this page of the book “at the ready” for reference. The symbols are a short-hand way of
expressing certain truths so they must be understood.

   (pp. vi-vii): Review the terms and work to memorize the basic meanings of each. This is a specialized
vocabulary that the author has developed to help the student quickly identify his meaning. These too must also
be understood; the student is encouraged to often refer back to these terms until they are memorized.

   To help in the learning process, define the following selected terms from the book:

   Conditional security:


   Legalism:


   Misthology:


   Proveitist:


   Securitist:



   Review the terms conditionalist, forfeitist, performatist, proveitist, and securitist.

Assuming you followed the study method suggested above, which term best described you before you read this
book? _________________________.


Which term best describes you now? __________________________.

If there is a difference, what caused you to change your mind?

   11. Write true or false in the blank: Entrance into heaven is offered freely to those who simply believe
       in Jesus Christ for eternal life ____________________ (p. 5).


   12. Place an “F” in front of the statements that are false (pp. 5-7).

18. Imagine a friend tells you that a person can believe in His name but not receive eternal life and
