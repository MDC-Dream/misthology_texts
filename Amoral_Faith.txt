                                                         Amoral Faith
                                                        Revised 10/25/2008
     Not everything that is of faith is morally acceptable nor must everything we do be classified as an example of morality or
immorality. There is another category: amorality. Rom 14:22-23 presents us with these three possibilities. This passage is
addressed to the strong versus weak believers’ enjoyment of things which may be considered amoral. Eating meat may be regarded
as an amoral action. On the other hand, just because a believer condones a certain practice because he believes it to be permissible,
this does not mean that he may not be condemning himself in what he condones by faith. Constable elaborates on amoral practices:
           Paul evidently wrote this verse [14:22] with the strong in view primarily (cf. v. 23). He did not want his readers to
           force their convictions (“faith”) about amoral practices on others. The strong believer can be happy in his private
           enjoyment of amoral practices because he knows that he is neither violating the will of God nor the conscience of
           a weak brother.
           This verse [14:23], in contrast to verse 22, seems addressed particularly to the weak. The weak brother who eats
           something that he believes he should not eat stands condemned by his own conscience and by God (cf. Gal. 2:11).
           His action is contrary to what he believes is right….If a person does what he believes to be wrong, even though it
           is not wrong in itself [and is thus normally amoral or moral], it becomes sin for him. He has violated what he
           believes to be God’s will. His action has become an act of rebellion against God for him. (Emphasis Added)1

     Paul said that if (A) the action is not of faith, then (B) it is sin. It may be concluded, therefore, that when an action which is
normally morally neutral or positive is not of faith it is of sin. Consequently, an amoral or moral action can be done in an immoral
manner and thus be regarded as an immoral action. On the other hand, if A then B does not prove if not A then not B. In other
words, just because something is of faith does not mean that it is not of sin, as Paul implies in 14:22. Or in terms of logic, (A     B)
    (~A     ~B) is not necessarily true. Therefore, the picture on the left has amoral2 and moral categories with neutrally yellow
strips passing through them. In contrast, the actions on the right have green strips passing through them to represent their being
misthologically riddled with sin since they are not of faith.
     The richness of Paul’s thought should help guard against simplistic attitudes which might assume: “Because I believe what I
am doing is right it must be alright.” Sincerity is a poor substitute for accuracy. One may be sincerely wrong. Saul believed he was
doing the right thing when he was persecuting the Christians. Such faith, however, was not a fruit of the Spirit nor were the actions
performed in this faith a fruit of the Spirit. It is likewise erroneous to assert that just because in some passages a gift is passively
received by faith (and would thus be misthologically neutral and marked as yellow) that in other passages (where works are
actively performed by faith) faith could not be misthologically marked as blue. The symmetry does not rule out neutrality or
misthology.
