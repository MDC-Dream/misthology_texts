                   Presumptive Sainthood:
            A Misthological Reward for the Faithful
                                                       11/7/2025


        Introduction: From Positional to Presumptive Sainthood
       My understanding of what the Bible means when it addresses believers as saints has undergone a three-step
migration: from soteriological, to soteriological-misthological, to exclusively misthological. Misthology refers to
the NT’s reward economy (misthos), distinct from the free gift of eternal life; it concerns rulership, glory, garments,
proximity, and access in the kingdom. Briefly, to outline the development in my understanding, in The Outer
Darkness (TOD), I argued that pistos in Eph 1:1 applies soteriologically to all “believers in Christ Jesus” (TM).
The designation saints (hagioi) was considered positional, an unmerited setting apart of all regenerates in Christ
(1Cor 1:2; 6:11). In Dual Sealing and Security (DSAS), I explored a soteriological-misthological duality: pistos
as “faithful” includes sainthood’s full range, thus rewards (e.g., inheritance, Eph 1:11). Now, in preparation for the
release of MMP7, presumptive sainthood is posed as the superior model, which is exclusively misthological.

        Presumptive sainthood holds that God graciously enrolls every newborn believer as a saint-candidate for
kingship; the title saint is provisional, and its realization awaits the Bema, yet only persevering, tested faith retains
the title to shine and reign (Dan 12:3; Rom 8:17b; Rev 3:4-5; 20:6). Sainthood is a fully misthological status—
presumptive for all believers at conversion, but ultimately realized and maintained only by the faithful who
will shine. 1 Unfaithful believers, though saved from the Lake of Fire, forfeit sainthood and thus have their names
erased from New Jerusalem’s registry (Phil 3:20; Rev 3:5). These believers are consigned to outer darkness, at the
outer limits of the kingdom, to live in eternal misthological regret (Mt 25:30). Sainthood is now seen as falling
under the umbrella of presumptive misthology in accordance with other presumptive models already posited.

      Establishing Presumptive Misthology
       Presumptive misthology posits that eschatological blessings (e.g., inheritance, city residency, glory) are
granted presumptively to all believers at the point of new birth and described in present-tense language (Eph 1:3;
Col 1:5), yet conditioned on perseverance for final realization. 2 This preserves soteriological security (eternal life
by grace, Eph 2:8-9) while locating contingencies in rewards (misthos). Dan 12:1-3 illustrates: All believers
“written in the book” will be raised at the end of the Tribulation. Some of these believers will be explicitly raised
to misthological life, but other believers raised at this time will be raised to misthological shame, thus implicitly
possessing eternal life.3 Only the “wise” shine misthologically as stars. Paul concurs that only faithful believers will
shine (see RBVGB). Unfaithful believers, though saved, do not shine and are excluded from glorified status.


      Presumptive Sainthood: A Conditional Reward Status
       Presumptive sainthood applies the thesis of presumptive misthology to the term saints (hagioi), so that
sainthood is understood as a misthological reward, not a soteriological identity. All believers are positionally
sanctified (1Cor 6:11) and initially presumptively qualified as saints to shine in the kingdom (Dan 12:3), but only
the faithful attain the status and title of saints at the Bema. 4

  Presumptive Misthology is a theological model that interprets many reward texts through a presumptive lens:
divine titles and blessings (e.g., heir, saint, overcomer, priestly ruler) are granted at conversion as provisional
designations but are confirmed or forfeited at the Bema. It unifies earlier already–not-yet and soteric–mistholic
dualities by locating both phases within the single field of misthology (the doctrine of reward). Thus, believers begin
their journey as presumptive heirs of kingdom privilege and are tested to determine whether that presumption will
stand.
3
  The syntax in Dan 12:1-3 is such that (1) one can either affirm that both groups explicitly possess eternal life
(which was the model defended in TOD) or (2) that only the first group is explicitly affirmed as possessing eternal
life, and the second group is implicitly inferred to have eternal life, since they are raised at that time, as the syntax
still affirms via the waw-consecutive. Both groups are raised at Israel’s end-time awakening at the conclusion of
the Tribulation. The latter model is the one posed in MMP8: Daniel’s Gospel of the Kingdom. Both models affirm
the misthological outcome of both groups and the soteriological security of those put to shame.
4
  Presumptive Sainthood is a specific application of presumptive misthology to the NT term hagios (holy one,
saint). Every believer is called a saint presumptively at the point of regeneration—addressed as holy in principle—
but only faithful believers will be recognized as saints ultimately, when perseverance and holiness are verified at
the Bema (cf. Dan 12:3; Rev 19:8). The model preserves assurance of salvation while grounding saintly status in
proven faithfulness: saints shine in the Reward City; shamed believers remain outside the Reward City.
Presumptive Sainthood                                                                                              Page 3
1Cor 1:2; 9:24-27
        In 1Cor 1:2, Paul addresses “the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in
Christ Jesus.” Their sanctification is affirmed, even though the Corinthians were notoriously unfaithful: divided
(1Cor 1:10-13), carnal (3:1-4), tolerating immorality (5:1-2), and suing each other (6:1-8). The perfect tense of
sanctified is positional (cp. Heb 10:10,14) and soteriologically true of all believers regardless of their performance.
        However, the next part of Paul’s salutation is open to question. He continues by saying that they are “saints
by calling” (NAS) or “called to be saints” (ESV, NET, NKJ). So, which is it? Are they already saints by calling, or
are saints something they are called to become? Presumptive misthology would affirm both. They already have the
title provisionally and will attain the rights and privileges associated with that title if they mature and prove faithful.
        Paul applies this OT title of saints to these believers and exhorts them to live up to the ethical implications
of this entitlement so that they can inherit the kingdom. He reminds them, for instance, that “the saints will judge
the world” (1Cor 6:2). Paul is drawing upon Dan 7:22,27 for his background for that statement, particularly the
LXX rendering of Dan 7:22: “He gave judgment to the saints” (LXE). In v. 22, Daniel immediately adds that at that
time, the saints take possession of the everlasting kingdom. Paul likewise immediately asks, “Do you not know
that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived” (1Cor 6:9). In full accord with
Daniel, Paul limits judgment and kingdom possession/inheritance to ethically righteous believers, that is, to saints.
When it comes time for judgment, not all believers will be considered saints. Paul’s exhortation is basically:
Because you are saints presumptively (i.e., provisionally, depending on the way you live), live faithfully to
qualify to be saints misthologically so that you can judge the world. Daniel would give a hearty, Amen!
                                             Illustration 3. Race of Saints
Presumptive Sainthood                                                                                            Page 4

       Paul later frames the same tension between presumptive and misthological sainthood in athletic terms
(1Cor 9:24-27). Though all believers are entered into the race by grace, only those who exercise disciplined self-
control “receive the prize.” The disqualified runner is not unsaved but unrewarded—set aside from rulership and
honor. Paul warns that even he, though an apostle, could become adokimos (disapproved/disqualified) if he fails to
master his body and serve faithfully. The imagery parallels Daniel’s portrayal of saints who must persevere to share
in the rulership (Dan 7:22,27). Thus, the Corinthians are saints by calling (1Cor 1:2), yet they must run lawfully to
become saints in actuality—those deemed worthy to inherit and to judge the world (6:2; cf. 2 Tim 2:12; Rev 2:26).
Col 1:2,22-23
        In Col 1:2, Paul addresses this epistle “to the saints [hagios] and faithful [pistos] brethren in Christ who are
at Colossae” (NAS). 5 One possibility is that Paul is only addressing faithful saints at Colossae. Another possibility
is that he has limited his designation of saints to those believers who are faithful: “the saints, the faithful brothers
and sisters in Christ, at Colossae” (NET).
        Regardless, Paul proceeds to condition their being/remaining saints at the Bema on their perseverance: “He
has now reconciled you… to present you holy [hagios] and blameless… if indeed you continue in the faith firmly
established and steadfast” (Col 1:22-23). Their retaining their misthological status of sainthood (hagios), possibly
ascribed to all believers in Col 1:2, is conditioned on performance, not guaranteed by grace. The Reformed view
often renders the conditional ei (“if”) as “since,” asserting that perseverance is necessary evidence of genuine
reconciliation, ensuring presentation as hagios. This Reformed model conditions preservation on perseverance,
nullifying salvation by grace alone (Eph 2:8-9) and making sainthood a soteriological reward—an accursed model
that robs believers of soteriological assurance, as one cannot be certain of persevering. In contrast, the Marrowist
presumptive model affirms soteriological security (unconditional salvation) while making sainthood a misthological
reward, preserving assurance and thus motivating holiness without fear of eternal damnation.
Eph 1:1; 5:5
       Similar observations can be made about Paul’s salutation to the Ephesians. One option is that he is addressing
all the believers in this church as faithful saints: “Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints
who are at Ephesus, and who are faithful in Christ Jesus” (NAS). Another possibility is that he considers only
faithful believers to be saints and thus defines saints as those who are faithful, addressing his epistle “to the saints
in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus” (NET). In the end, it makes little difference. Once again, being/remaining
a saint at the Bema is conditioned on faithfulness:
      3
       But do not let immorality or any impurity or greed even be named among you, as is proper among
      saints [hagios]; 4 and there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting,
      but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or
      covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 6 Let no one
      deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of
      disobedience. 7 Therefore do not be partakers with them. (Eph 5:3-7)

       Rather than participate in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom, disobedient believers will forfeit their
saintly inheritance. Given the OT background in Daniel ch. 7, such limitations and warnings are entirely reasonable.
Daniel describes an everlasting rulership and kingdom (Dan 7:14). And Daniel explicitly states that “the saints of
the Highest One” are the ones who will receive this kingdom and possess it forever (Dan 7:18). He reiterates: “The
Ancient of Days came, and judgment was passed in favor of the saints of the Highest One, and the time arrived
when the saints took possession of the kingdom” (Dan 7:22; NAS). 6 Yet a third time, Daniel states: “And the
kingdom and the rulership and the greatness of all the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people
of the saints of the Highest One” (Dan 7:27; TM). 7 The inheritance and rulership of the kingdom is limited to the

5
  Translations render pistos as faithful, though rendering it as believers would be plausible in this context (see TOD).
6
  If one opts for the translation “judgment was passed in favor of the saints” (Dan 7:22; NAS), it still contextually
includes judgment being given to the saints (Dan 7:27).
7
  The terms translated “rulership” (Aram. sholton) and “kingdom/kingship” (malku) in Daniel 7 emphasize active
governing authority rather than mere territorial possession. The terms are not used merely spatially but also
Presumptive Sainthood                                                                                           Page 5
saints by Daniel and to faithful believers by Paul. The conclusion is simple: Only faithful believers are considered
saints. Only saints qualify for rulership of the kingdom and thus kingship. And only saints shine.
        Daniel lays the foundation for this conclusion, affirming that only faithful believers raised at the end of the
Tribulation will shine like stars. In contrast, unfaithful believers are raised to misthological shame (Dan 12:1-3).
Only faithful saints inherit the kingdom’s glory, shining as stars (Dan 12:3). Saints shine. Unfaithful believers do
not. Paul taught the same thing in 1Cor 15:41 (see RBVGB). Yet Paul makes at least two significant advancements
as he builds upon Daniel’s foundation. First, Paul’s gospel of the kingdom is not limited to the Jews and does not
require that the Gentiles become Jews to inherit this everlasting kingdom. Second, the Pauline version of the gospel
of the kingdom repeatedly applies the term saint to all believers presumptively. All believers, Gentiles included,
are in the running to qualify as saints at the Bema and thus inherit this kingdom. Therefore, Paul repeatedly affirms
the sainthood of all believers. Nevertheless, in accord with Daniel and other NT writers, Paul will limit the retention
of this status and the realization of its misthological intention to the faithful.
Phil 1:1; 3:18-19
       In Pauline misthology, forfeiture of one’s status as a saint is possible before the Bema. Some believers
apostatize to the point where all hopes of their inheriting the kingdom and thus qualifying to be saints are forfeited.
Paul begins with his familiar salutation the Philippians: “to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi”
(Phil 1:1). Nevertheless, he will proceed to express sorry over some believers who have abandoned their previous
faithfulness: “Many walk… as enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction [apoleia]… who set their
minds on earthly things” (Phil 3:18-19).
       The background for this Paul’s exhortation to stand firm is given in view of the eschatological destruction of
unfaithful believers, alluded to in Phil 3:19 (cp. 1:15-17; 2:21), thus providing the impetus for the moral exhortation
to stand firm in the Lord in Phil 4:1. These enemies of the cross are former citizens of the kingdom who
presumptively were to receive glorified bodies but now have had their glory turned into misthological shame
(Phil 3:18-21). When Paul says that their glory is their shame (3:19), what glory is he talking about? He immediately
supplies the answer with an explanatory for (gar): When their glory of being transformed into glorified bodies
(3:21) was supposed to occur, it will be the occasion and source of their shame instead.

experientially. The CJB captures this nuance by rendering sholton as “rulership” (Dan 7:14,27). This clarifies that
the Son of Man and the saints of the Most High share in administrative dominion, not simply residence within a
kingdom.
       Several LXX manuscripts preserve the phrase didomi…exousia (“ruling authority was given”) in Dan 7:14
and combine basileia and exousia in Dan 7:27 (“the kingship and the rulership were given…”). Rev 2:26 repeats
this didomi-exousia connection: “I will give him rulership over the nations”). Thus, the exousia given (didomi) to
the Son of Man in Daniel is the exousia given (didomi) by Christ to His overcoming saints—forming a direct Greek
verbal and conceptual chain of delegated rule. This ruling authority (aka rulership) is given to Christ and then given
by Christ to His victorious saints.
       The eternal rulership (Dan 7:14) is equatable with eternal kingship (Dan 7:27). The saints receive and possess
the kingdom spatially (Dan 7:18,22). But exercising kingship is how one possesses a kingdom. Naturally, the LXX
also renders Daniel 7:27b with basileia—kingship. NT commentators note that basileia can be frequently translated
as kingship. This dynamic is seen in this OT background as well. The Greek translators viewed Daniel’s rulership
and kingdom as equivalent to kingship, the very term the New Testament later employs for the presumptive
misthological inheritance of the saints. The LXX, therefore, provides early linguistic confirmation that the dominion
promised to the saints is royal in nature.
       In the NT, this promise is often expressed through basileia (kingship, royal rule), underscoring continuity
between Daniel’s prophecy and Christ’s reward language to the faithful. Daniel’s rulership (sholton) corresponds
in the NT to kingship (basileia). This royal motif extends to the saints themselves: Peter calls the faithful basileios—
kingly (1 Pet 2:9)—expressing presumptive kingship awaiting misthological fulfillment. Paul affirms the same
destiny: If we endure, we shall also sumbasileuo—co-rule as kings—with Him (2Tim 2:12; TM).
       Across the NT, believers’ basileia (“kingship,” not merely “realm”) and their sumbasileuo (“co-rule as
kings”) confirm that Daniel’s promised rulership is realized as shared kingship with the Son of Man. Thus,
rulership in Daniel and kingship/co-rulership/co-kingship in the NT describe the same misthological inheritance—
the co-regal authority and kingship of faithful saints.

 interests, not those of Christ Jesus. (Phil 2:19-21)

       Phil 3:19 is dealing with regenerate believers (MMP1), facing misthological destruction—eternal shame in
outer darkness, not Hell. Their presumptive “City citizenship [politeuma]” in the Heavenly Reward City has been
forfeited (Phil 3:20). As explained in MMP5, the seat of our heavenly citizenship is the Heavenly City. The best
gloss is: “Our City citizenship is in the heavens, from which City also we eagerly wait for a Savior.” After all,
the Greek word for city is polis, from which the word citizenship (politeuma) is derived.
       A verbal form is found in Phil 1:27. The NAS translates (politeuo) as conduct: “Only conduct yourselves in
a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ” (Phil 1:27). But this translation fails to convey the fact that politeuo is
verbally related to the noun city (polis). A suitable expanded translation would be: “Only, as citizens of the
Heavenly City, live in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ” (Phil 1:27; TM). A misthopological gospel is in
view. In Phil 1:27 and 3:20, respectively, Paul exhorts us to live as citizens of this Heavenly City (politeuo) in view
of our citizenship in that Heavenly City (politeuma). This Heavenly City is the literal city of New Jerusalem,
explicitly described time and again in Revelation as a reward given to those who overcome (e.g., Rev 3:12; 22:19).
       The citizenship within the Heavenly City affirmed in Phil 3:20 is contrasted with the eschatological
destruction of unfaithful believers, alluded to in Phil 3:18-19. By abandoning the gospel of the kingdom either
morally or doctrinally, they became enemies of the gospel of the kingdom. Just as believers can be enemies of God
via their friendship with the world (Jam 4:4), so they can become enemies of the cross via worldly desires. Paul is
not weeping over false brethren, but antinomian brethren. Faithful believers retain their citizenship in the Heavenly
City since citizenship in this City is a reward; indeed, it is the prize of the upward call in Phil 3:14. Unfaithful
believers forfeit their citizenship in this City.
       Placing the misthological destruction of such believers within the contrastive context of Phil 3:20 provides
the impetus for the moral exhortation for believers to stand firm in the Lord in Phil 4:1. An exclusively soteric
citizenship makes little sense as grounds for appealing for moral performance in a context of misthological
destruction. What would be the misthological end of such believers? The telic (telos) destruction of these particular
heavenly citizens in Philippians gives grounds for concluding that their names will be erased from the heavenly
registry pertaining to this City. They will reap misthological destruction. Misthopologically, they will be in the
outer darkness. The our of v. 20 jumps back to the brethren described in v. 17 who walk worthily and who are
called beloved brethren in 4:1. It excludes the enemy brethren who walk licentiously in vv. 18-19. Paul’s point in
Phil 3:18-20 is that enemy brethren reap misthological destruction in the form of misthopological (Reward-City)
exclusion. Therefore, we are enjoined to walk in a manner worthy of our misthological citizenship since, otherwise,
it can be forfeited.
       Unfaithful believers lose their registry in the New Jerusalem (Rev 3:5). City citizenship is reserved for the
faithful (Heb 12:23, NKJ), motivating Paul’s call to “stand firm” (Phil 4:1, NAS). Believers who abandon the gospel
of the kingdom will enter the kingdom but not the kingship of the kingdom or retain their Heavenly City citizenship.
Paul excludes these enemies of the cross from his salutation to the saints because these enemies are no longer saints.
They are no longer provisionally qualified to inherit the kingdom or enter the Reward City.
       Misthological destruction (apoleia) is repeatedly affirmed in Scripture (cp. Acts 8:20; 1Tim 6:9; Heb 10:38-
Presumptive Sainthood                                                                                             Page 7
39). Some of the more interesting affirmations of such destruction are found in texts that are typically assumed to
be limited to soteriological destruction. For instance, in TOD, I was inclined to follow the traditional soteriological
interpretation of Mt 7:13-14, in which the narrow gate that leads to “life” versus the broad gate that leads to
“destruction” are understood purely soteriologically. However, I subsequently concluded that, for believers, this is
misthological destruction. The faithful find a glorified life, while unfaithful believers face a Gehenna Bema—loss
in outer darkness (1Cor 3:15; Mt 25:30). Other misthologists have reached similar conclusions (cf. Eaton, TBEB;
Dillow, Destiny).
       Naturally, the most popular text on irremediable apostasy is Heb 6:4-6. Attempts to circumvent the
irreversible misthological nature of this apostasy within that epistle are futile, since the broader context affirms that,
once some believers reach the point at which God swears in wrath, they cannot enter His rest (Heb 3:11; 4:3). The
loss of hope to enter the misthological rest is misthological destruction. Such believers would lose their opportunity
for misthological rest and their presumptive status as saints. Even so, their positional sanctification remains perfect
and permanent (Heb 10:10,14), thereby assuring their soteriological security. However, as the writer of Hebrews
continues to point out at the end of that chapter, those believers who do not “who have faith to the preserving of the
soul,” like those he described in chs 3-6, “shrink back to destruction” (Heb 10:39). The loss of their souls would
entail misthological destruction.
2Thess 1:10
       Indeed, Scott Crawford led an extended study through the Thessalonian epistles in which Doug Berner and I
participated. Crawford provided a preliminary analysis of why some unfaithful believers might be included in the
destruction described by Paul in 2Thess 1:8-9. I wrote MMP7 to investigate this proposition in greater detail and to
trace its logical implications. Our friend, Doug Berner, also a participant in this study, was not persuaded as to the
possible misthological application of the passage during the survey.
       The present article is an introduction to the proposition first suggested by Crawford and then developed at
great length by me in MMP7 regarding the misthological applicability of 2Thess 1:8-9. However, my primary
reason for releasing this article before MMP7 is to explain my migration from positional sainthood to presumptive
sainthood. This auxiliary development arose from my analysis within MMP7. Thus, this article aims to expand on
this proposition regarding sainthood and, at the same time, briefly introduce the primary theme of MMP7. The
principal point of MMP7 is that Paul’s statement is not limited to unbelievers when he says that “those who do not
obey the gospel” face “eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord.” Such fate applies inclusively to
unfaithful believers, who will suffer eternal misthological exclusion in the outer darkness, not soteriological loss.
In the present article, note that Paul contrasts those disobedient to the gospel with the saints. Moreover, saints are
not described/defined as mere believers but as believers who remain faithful to their calling.

        We should always give thanks to God for you, brethren, as is only fitting, because your faith is
      growing exceedingly, and the love of each one of you toward one another is growing abundantly;
      4
        therefore, we ourselves speak proudly of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and
      faith in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure. 5 This is a plain indication
      of God’s righteous judgment so that you may be considered worthy of the kingship of God, for
      which indeed you are suffering. 6 For it is only right for God to repay with affliction those who afflict
      you, 7 and to repay rest to you who are afflicted and to us as well at the revelation of the Lord Jesus
      from Heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, 8 paying out retribution to those who do not
      know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 9 And these will pay the
      penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His
      power, 10 when He comes on that Day to be glorified in His saints and to be marveled at among all
      who have believed—for our testimony to you was believed. 11 To this end also we always pray for
      you so that our God may count you worthy of the calling, and fulfill every desire for goodness and
      the work of faith with power; 12 in order that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you,
      and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ…It was for this He
      called you through our gospel, for earning the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. So then, brethren,
      stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught.” (2Thess 1:3-12; 2:14-15 TM)

       MMP7 deals with these passages at length, but for our purposes, note that Paul is commending these faithful
believers for their perseverance and faith, both of which are required for them to be considered saints and worthy
of the kingship of God. They are enduring suffering to be counted worthy of this kingship. 8 As prophesied by
Daniel, saints will shine. Accordingly, God will be glorified by their saintly glory. Parallelism allows us to make
an observational definition as to the identity of the saints:
                            Illustration 6. Parallelism for Saintly Glory and Kingship

               and to be marveled at among all who have believed…To this end, we also always pray for you, so
               that our God may count you worthy of the calling… so that the name of our Lord Jesus may
               be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

                                   Illustration 7. Prayer to Be Counted Worthy




       Christ will come and be glorified in His saints. Paul prays that the Thessalonians will be counted worthy.
Moreover, he links it contextually with obeying the gospel in 2Thess 1:8, plus with earned glory in that context and
in 2Thess 2:14-15. Not all believers will be worthy of the calling to kingship and saintly glory. Only God’s saints
will receive the glory being described in this passage. Unfaithful believers are excluded from this saintly glory. The
term “saints” applies to those in whom Jesus will be glorified. Saints will shine with glory because they have proven
worthy of the call to kingship. Being counted worthy of this misthological calling is dependent upon remaining
obedient to the misthological gospel of the kingdom/kingship. Therefore, Paul prays that the Thessalonians will be
counted worthy of this calling so that Jesus may be glorified in them because this glorification is for “His saints.” 9

  As frequently noted by commentators and elaborated upon in my writings, basileia can be translated as spatially
as kingdom or experientially as kingship.

  Paul offers a similar prayer for the Ephesians: “I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you
may know what is the hope of His calling” (Eph 1:18). His confident expectation that these presumptively saintly
believers will grow and persevere in order to bring the hope of their misthological calling into eschatological
Presumptive Sainthood                                                                                            Page 9
                                         If you ain’t a saint, you won’t be glorified.

       In this context, being a saint (hagios, a holy one) and thus being glorified at that time is conditioned on having
a growing, persevering faith. Those believers who fail to grow and persevere forfeit their status as saints and their
hope of being counted worthy of their calling to be worthy of the kingship. They are excluded from the saints as
described/defined by Paul in this passage. All believers will marvel at the Lord, but He will only be glorified in His
saintly believers. Obedience to the gospel in this context requires more than just believing in Jesus for eternal life,
because this passage concerns the gospel of the kingdom/kingship. The gospel of the kingdom is that faithful
believers are worthy of their calling to rule and shine in that kingdom. Saints refer to faithful believers who are
glorified because they are counted worthy of their calling to kingship.
                          Illustration 8. Names of Apostates Removed from City Registry




      Since the prayer is for “you,” that is, for the Thessalonians who are obeying the gospel of the kingdom, it
would not apply to believers who have abandoned the gospel of the kingdom. The names of apostates would be
erased from the prayer list and the presumptive list of saints recorded in the Heavenly City registry.


realization is well founded but does not convey unconditional certainty. This calling has nothing to do with
unconditional security. All believers have unconditional security regarding their positional sanctification. In fact,
this foundational understanding is part of Dan 12:2. Paul builds upon this Danielic bedrock. All believers will be
raised before the millennial kingdom starts. Some believers will be raised to enter the kingdom in eternal
misthological shame, not to soteriological damnation. Saintly believers will be raised to inherit the kingdom and
shine with eternal misthological glory. As seen through the Pauline application, Dan 12:2 is one of the strongest
pictures of salvation by grace apart from works in the OT. NT writers demonstrate this time and again throughout
their writings via their misthology. Unfaithful believers enter the kingdom in shame; faithful believers inherit the
kingdom and shine.
Presumptive Sainthood                                                                                          Page 10
Heb 3:1
        This is the subject matter of Hebrews, which addresses its readers as “holy [hagios] brethren, partakers of a
heavenly calling” (Heb 3:1). Being a partaker of the calling to inherit the kingdom is conditioned on by being holy,
that is, being a saint. Perhaps, the connection will be more evident if we note that the epistle is written for saintly
brethren. The Greek adjective hagios denotes “holy, set apart,” and when used substantively, it refers to “saints”—
those consecrated to God. English translations typically render the adjective as holy and the noun as saints,
obscuring the lexical unity inherent in Greek. Rendering hagios adjectivally as saintly restores that connection,
making the relationship between title and character transparent. While “saintly” in modern English often suggests
moral virtue, its etymology and semantic range align with the biblical concept of consecration. More importantly,
the moral dimension is contextually affirmed: misthological retention and realization of sainthood require ethical
correspondence to positional sanctification. Believers who live saintly lives honor God’s consecration and will be
honored as saints by God. In short, faithful saints dismantle the false dichotomy between consecration and virtue—
they embody both.
        The golden halo has long symbolized sanctity in Catholic art, but its theological function differs from what
is proposed here. In Catholicism, the halo marks canonized sainthood—a recognition of extraordinary virtue after
death. By contrast, the misthological halo is a Protestant conceptual tool, applied presumptively to all believers at
regeneration and retained only by those who persevere in faith and holiness. It signifies provisional sainthood and
anticipates future glorification, corresponding to the believer’s potential to “shine like stars” (Dan 12:3). Apostates
and unfaithful believers lose this halo, forfeiting their misthological status as saints while remaining secure in
soteriological salvation. Thus, the halo becomes a vivid emblem of reward theology, not sacramental
canonization—a symbol of kingdom inheritance conditioned on faithfulness, not a badge of ecclesiastical approval.
My implementation of this symbol is mistholic, not Catholic.
        Saint Peter elaborates that moral virtue is how believers make their misthological calling and election secure.
Given the Danielic background about the kingdom, it makes sense that Saint Peter urges all his readers to be saints
in the moral sense so that they can be saints in the misthological sense:
      5
       Now for this very reason also, do your very best to add moral virtue to your faith; and to your moral
      virtue, knowledge; 6 and to your knowledge, self-control, and to your self-control, perseverance, and
      to your perseverance, godliness; 7 and to your godliness, brotherly kindness, and to your brotherly
      kindness, love. 8 For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, then they render you neither useless
      nor unfruitful in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 9 For he who lacks these qualities is blind
      or short-sighted, having forgotten his purification from his former sins. 10 Therefore, brethren, do your
      best to make your calling and election secure; for as long as you practice these things, you will never
      stumble; 11 for in this way the entrance into the eternal kingship of our Lord and Savior Jesus
      Christ will be richly supplied to you. (2Pet 1:5-11; TM)

       Peter’s exhortation in 2 Peter 1:5-11 perfectly illustrates the misthological halo concept. The golden halo,
applied presumptively at regeneration, is not static—it brightens as believers add virtue to faith and dims when
these qualities are neglected. Peter’s sequence—faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness,
brotherly kindness, and love—maps the path from presumptive sainthood to realized sainthood. The reward is
not mere entrance into heaven but “rich entrance into the eternal kingship” (v.11), corresponding to the halo’s
ultimate confirmation in glorification. Conversely, those who lack these qualities are “blind” and risk forfeiting
their halo, losing their misthological calling while remaining soteriologically secure. In this way, the halo becomes
a vivid emblem of Peter’s theology: grace grants the saintly title presumptively, but moral virtue secures its
permanence.
       Catholic theology reserves the halo for those who have been canonized—officially recognized by the Church
after death for heroic virtue and miracles. This is an ecclesiastical declaration of completed sanctity. By contrast,
the misthological halo is not posthumous but provisional: granted at regeneration, retained through perseverance,
and confirmed at the Bema. It symbolizes a believer’s potential for glory and rulership, not institutional approval.
In short, Catholic halos celebrate sainthood achieved; misthological halos anticipate sainthood rewarded—
immortalized in the kingdom for those who endure. This halo is misthologically immortalized rather than
ecclesiastically canonized.
Presumptive Sainthood                                                                                         Page 11
Rev 3:4-5
       In Revelation, we find that some believers soil their garments, while others do not. These garments are
presumptively described as already being part of their attire: “But you have a few names in Sardis of saints who
have not soiled their garments; and they will walk with Me in white; for they are worthy.10 He who overcomes
shall thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not erase his name from the book of life, and I will confess his
name before My Father, and before His angels” (Rev 3:4-5; TM). All believers start presumptively as being
clothed in white garments and having their names in misthological portion of the Book of Life. Only faithful
believers, that is, overcomers, will retain their names in the misthological section of the Book of Life. Unfaithful
believers have their names erased from the reward section and forfeit their presumptive right to receive white
garments. The white garments are, of course, the “righteous acts of the saints” (Rev 19:8). Those believers lacking
white garments are not considered saints. They have forfeited their presumptive misthological status as saints. Still,
their names remain in the soteriological section of the Book of Life. They will spend eternity in the kingdom of
heaven, not in the Lake of Fire.
Rev 14:12
       Revelation 14:12 defines what it truly means to be a saint: “Here is the perseverance of the saints, those who
keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus” (ESV). The Greek structure shows that the second clause
explains the first: the saints are those who keep on obeying and believing. In this apocalyptic setting, hagios—
”holy one” or “saint”—is not a blanket label for all believers. It marks those believers who persevere in both faith
and faithfulness.
       This distinction harmonizes with other Revelation passages. In Rev 19:8, the Bride’s fine linen represents
“the righteous acts of the saints.” Not every believer contributes to that garment—only those who have clothed
themselves in practical righteousness. Likewise, Rev 22:11 commands, “Let the one who is holy, still keep himself
holy.” The verb is active and imperative; holiness must be maintained, not merely received. Those who keep
themselves holy correspond to the overcomers of Rev 20:6: “Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first
resurrection.” Their holiness is experiential and rewarded, the outcome of perseverance before the Bema.
       Taken together, these verses portray holiness as dynamic rather than static. Every believer is sanctified
positionally (1Cor 6:11), but Revelation limits hagios to those believers who demonstrate that sanctification in
endurance and obedience. Within the framework of presumptive sainthood, Rev 14:12 shows how the presumption
becomes a confirmed reality. All believers are entered on the misthological roll as saints at conversion, yet only the
faithful retain that title when Christ evaluates His own. Even if sainthood is revoked in a misthological judgment,
it has no impact on soteriological security. The unfaithful remain saved from the Lake of Fire but stand in shadow,
away from the Heavenly City, lacking the radiance that belongs to those who kept faith and obedience. Thus,
Revelation’s “saints” are the faithful overcomers whose endurance secures the goal of their calling—those who
kept themselves holy and will shine as stars forever (Dan 12:3).
1Pet 2:9
       Peter exhorts believers, “Like the Holy One who called you, be/become holy yourselves also in all your
behavior” (1Pet 1:15, TM). The verb ginomai is in the imperative middle voice, urging a voluntary, experiential
holiness. It is not a statement of fact but a command for transformation—believers are to be/become what they are
in the process of becoming. In the next verse, many translations read, “You will be holy, for I am holy” (1Pet 1:16).

10
   The reference to onoma in Sardis (“names in Sardis”) uses onoma (“names”) as the accusative object. Although
onoma can function metonymically for “person,” John’s repeated use of the term in verse 5 (“I will not erase his
name… I will confess his name…”) shows that he intentionally preserves its literal sense—name—to form a
deliberate wordplay on divine remembrance and confession. A more literal rendering of verse 4 could therefore
read, “You have a few names in Sardis—saints who have not soiled their garments.” However, a smoother
interpretive gloss for the English reader would be, “You have a few names in Sardis of saints who have not soiled
their garments.”
       In either translation, the referents are clearly saints—faithful believers whose white garments symbolize
righteous conduct. The Epistle itself identifies those who wear such garments as saints: “It was given to her to clothe
herself in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts [works] of the saints” (Rev 19:8).
Likewise, saints are defined elsewhere in the book as those “who keep the commandments of God and their faith in
Jesus” (Rev 14:12). Rendering onoma as “saints” rather than the generic “people” thus better preserves the
contextual and theological link between moral purity, worthiness, and eschatological reward.
Presumptive Sainthood                                                                                           Page 12
Yet even if the textual form eimi (“you will be”) is adopted, the context demands that it be understood imperatively.
It carries the sense, “You are to be holy.”
        Thus, Peter calls his readers to advance from presumptive holiness to practical holiness—to grow into the
moral likeness of the One who called them. His exhortation is not a promise that God will automatically make them
holy, but a command that they make themselves holy in the active, behavioral sense. The future aspect of the verb
looks ahead to a holiness still unrealized, one that will be examined at the believer’s judgment.
        In the next chapter, Peter affirms, “You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation” (1Pet 2:9). The
tension between these two passages is deliberate. The readers are already addressed as holy, yet they are also
commanded to become holy. This duality fits the pattern of presumptive misthology: the title holy/saintly nation
and royal priesthood are granted presumptively at conversion. All believers are called holy, that is, saints, in this
passage. However, the realization of these titles—the actual exercise of saintly, priestly, and royal authority—
remains conditional upon perseverance.
        As Exodus 19:5-6 shows, the identity of a “royal priesthood” was always contingent on obedience: “If you
will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be to Me a royal priesthood and a holy nation.”
Peter intentionally echoes this covenant formula. Believers are potentially kings and saints now (Rev 1:6; 5:10), but
the function of that office awaits those who remain faithful. In that sense, our priestly and royal titles are
presumptive—bestowed in grace, validated in obedience.
        Thus, 1Pet 2:9 becomes the moral hinge of the presumptive model. Peter applies these titles—royal
[basileios] and holy [hagios]—to these believers provisionally, that is, on the condition that they meet the
requirements for their future realization of these roles as kings and saints. Every believer is called holy and royal in
principle, yet saintship and kingship are attained only through practical sanctification. Those who “become holy”
in behavior confirm the calling they received; those who neglect it forfeit the experiential reality of that title. Grace
gives the designation, but perseverance determines its permanence.
Rom 1:7
       As with Paul’s opening salutation in his other epistles, Paul’s salutation to the Roman believers (Rom 1:7)
as “called as saints” (NAS) or “called to be saints” (ESV, NET, NKJ) is a presumptive declaration. The epistle
establishes their justification by faith apart from works as soteriologically secure (Rom 3:28; 4:5). However, the
realization of the saint’s ultimate (reward)—their royal destiny—is explicitly presented as conditional. The title of
“saint” derives from the Old Testament concept of a people set apart to be kings and judges, as seen in Daniel 7. To
realize this function, the believer must persevere. This tension is most clearly articulated in the principle of co-
heirship. All believers are heirs of God, but only faithful believers are co-heirs with Christ and thus co-glorified
with Christ (Rom 8:17). Co-heirship is the misthological intent of their saintship.
                                             Illustration 9. Run Lawfully
Presumptive Sainthood                                                                                           Page 13
       This conditional principle is further confirmed by the stark warning to the Gentiles regarding their place in
God’s plan. Building on the Old Testament precedent—where Israel’s status as a “holy nation” (Ex 19:5-6; cp.
1Pet 2:9) was conditional upon obedience—Paul warns the grafted-in Gentile believers: “To you, God’s kindness,
if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off” (Rom 11:22).
       Since their justification by faith apart from works is secure in Christ, this threat of being “cut off” must be a
warning against forfeiting the realized presumptive blessings of the covenant—the function of their presumptive
sainthood. In short, all believers addressed by the Romans epistle are saints by calling, but only those who remain
faithful in suffering will achieve the realized glorified status of co-reigning saints at the Bema. Grace gives the
designation presumptively; performance ultimately determines the inheritance.
       Understandably, the fact that believers can be cut off or cast out is a common theme in the OT and the NT.
The gospel of the kingdom is that the Messiah and His saints will co-rule in the coming kingdom. Namely, believers
who progress and persevere in holiness qualify to be called holy ones (saints) and therefore will inherit/possess the
everlasting kingdom and undergo a transformation that results in their shining like stars. Daniel is a primary OT
background for this possibility (Dan 7:14,18,22,27; 12:2-3). Naturally, those believers who fail to qualify will lose
their potential for such saintship/rulership. Although all believers can initially and presumptively be described as
saints, since they have been positionally sanctified and qualified to run in this race for kingdom acquisition, they
may forfeit their status as saints and as competitors for kingship if they fail to compete according to the rules of this
race. Thus, Paul uses this race imagery to say, “If anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless
he competes according to the rules [nomimos]” (2Tim 2:5).

Mt 5:13

                                                     Blessed Saints
      Jesus likewise used various parables and analogies to teach the same thing. His Sermon on the Mount begins
by promising various blessings to His saintly believers. These saints are described as possessing various attributes:
being poor in spirit, merciful, gentle, righteous, pure in heart, and peacemakers. 11 They are promised various
rewards in an inclusio that emphasizes their potential/provisional/presumptive possession of the kingdom (Mt 5:3-
10). Basically, it is a recap of the OT doctrine of the kingdom, brought to a focal point by Daniel.

                                                  Saltless Saints
       After these misthological beatitudes, Jesus continues by issuing this warning to this same group of saintly
saints on whom He had just pronounced presumptive blessings:
      11
        “Blessed are you when men cast insults at you, and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against
      you falsely, on account of Me. 12 “Rejoice, and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great, for so they
      persecuted the prophets who were before you. 13 “You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has
      become tasteless, how will it be made salty again? It is good for nothing anymore, except to be thrown
      out and trampled under foot by men. (Mt 5:11-13)

      Jesus is addressing the same group in all three verses—you—the mature believers whom He has just
described in saintly terms. He warns these mature saints, whom He just described in the beatitudes—who are saints

11
  In Mt 5:3, poor (ptochos) means utterly destitute—someone who must depend entirely on others to survive. The
clarification in spirit denotes an awareness of one’s utter dependency on God to meet their spiritual needs to qualify
for the rewards being described in the Sermon on the Mount. The phrase is frequently misconstrued to mean
acknowledging that we can do nothing to earn God’s favor. To the contrary, the Beatitudes are all about earning
God’s favor via rewards. Jesus is not saying, “Blessed are those who realize they can’t do anything.” Every
Beatitude is reward-oriented—they’re all conditional blessings tied to divine recompense, not unearned gifts.
These attributes are found in those who are poor in spirit because they are Spirit-enabled. Paul manifests this spirit
when he says, “I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me” (1Cor 15:10). Rather
than being a statement of pride, it is a statement of spiritual poverty/dependency. Being poor in spirit is not thinking
that you cannot do anything right; instead, it is believing that you can do all things through Christ who strengthens
you (Phil 4:13).

experientially, not merely presumptively—that they can become unsaintly and forfeit their saintly status and
potential to possess the kingdom. Even presently, in this life, they can be trampled underfoot by humanity as unsalty.
If that happens to them, Jesus warns, their saltiness cannot be restored. In other words, these mature saints, if they
turn back, have reached the point where the Lord would no longer consider them salty, and they will have forfeited
their potential to inherit the kingdom. If they abandon the kingdom path and message, they forfeit their salt/saint
status and potential to enter the kingship.
        Ezekiel put it this way: “But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity, and
does according to all the abominations that a wicked man does, will he live? All his righteous deeds which he has
done will not be remembered for his treachery which he has committed and his sin which he has committed; for
them he will die” (Eze 18:24). A righteous man, thus an experiential saint, who becomes
unrighteous/unsaintly/unsalty is no longer considered a righteous man, saint, or salt. He will die in an
unrighteous/unsaintly/unsalty state as far as possession of the kingdom is concerned. To remain
righteous/saintly/salty, mature believers must persevere in the kingdom path and message.
        Thus, the writer of Hebrews exhorts: “But My righteous one shall live by faith; and if he shrinks back, My
soul has no pleasure in him. But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to
the preserving of the soul” (Heb 10:38-39). Yet what about those believers who do shrink back from the kingdom
program? They forfeit the salvation of their souls/lives in terms of possessing the kingdom. This misthological loss
will be devastating and hence is appropriately called destruction and is pictured in that capacity with multiple terms
and imagery in the NT.

                                             Matthean Inclusio
     For present purposes, let’s focus on a misthological inclusio Jesus used to summarize His teaching in the
Sermon on the Mount:

           •   “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” (Mt 5:3).
           •   “Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the
               kingdom of heaven.” (Mt 5:10)

       The kingdom/kingship of heaven is theirs. The kingship of heaven belongs to them. When? Now—
presumptively. This kingship belongs to them, even now, because of their saintship. But if they do not persevere in
their saintship, then they forfeit their kingship. Saintship and kingship go hand in hand. If you forfeit the one, you
forfeit the other. This is how Jesus introduces this theme in the NT.

                                              Jesus Reissues His Warning
       When we turn to Revelation, we see how Jesus closes this theme. There, He warns: “I am coming quickly;
hold fast what you have, in order that no one take your crown” (Rev 3:11). Do you already have a crown?
Presumptively, yes. But you can forfeit it. The inverse is also possible, Jesus offers this promise to some worldly
believers: “I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire, that you may become rich, and white garments, that
you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your
eyes, that you may see” (Rev 3:18). Are worldly believers already misthological naked? Have they already forfeited
their misthological white garments, their misthologically saintly status? Yes, presumptively. However, for many of
them—if they repent and return—they can hope to regain their presumptive status as saints and their white robes.
       What about those believers who take away the presumptive intent of these warnings and thus misconstrue
the gospel of the kingdom? Revelation ends with this warning: “If anyone takes away from the words of the book
of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life” (Rev 22:19). Unbelievers do not have a part
in the Tree of Life to lose. This warning applies to believers. Believers, by default, presumptively have a
misthological right to the Tree of Life. It is a right they currently possess but can forfeit. The realization of the right
to the Tree of Life is a reward limited to believers who overcome: “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God”
(Rev 2:7). Those believers who take away from the misthological warnings and promises of the Tree of Life by
making it a gift to all believers place themselves in danger of losing their present presumptive right to the Tree of
Life and thereby failing to be able to eat from it in the future.

       But this observation takes us back to the concluding chapter of Daniel, who was told: “Many will be purged,
purified and refined; but the wicked will act wickedly, and none of the wicked will understand, but those who have
insight will understand” (Dan 12:10). Wicked believers will take away from the message of Daniel and from the
gospel call by Jesus and have their portion in the Tree of Life taken away. Such wicked believers will not be part
of the saints who possess the kingdom/kingship. They forfeit their saintship and thus their potential for rulership.
They will be in the kingdom as subjects, not rulers. Those believers who limit the gospel call to soteriology greatly
limit the scope of that call and resist the full intent of that call—to call believers to be saints who inherit the
kingdom/kinship. Salty salt ascends triumphantly to the Reward City. Unsalty salt does not.

                                                     False Teachers
       Jesus masterfully juxtaposes Mt 5:13 and 5:22 with the mor-wordplay to force a decision: salt that becomes
foolish (moraino) is thrown out, and the one who calls a brother “fool” (moros) in contempt stands in danger of
Gehenna fire. The tension is not between judging and not judging—it is between righteous judgment and
unrighteous judgment. Scripture does not allow a false dichotomy between “judge the teaching, not the person.” If
the teaching is false, the teacher is a false teacher—a wolf, a dog, a pig, a fool (Mt 7:15; 2Pet 2:22).
       Jesus warns us to judge righteously rather than unrighteously (Mt 7:1-5; Jn 7:24). Yet, in that very context,
the Lord instructs us to discern who are dogs, swine, and false prophets (Mt 7:6,15-20). We are not necessarily
judging whether those teaching false doctrine and opposing the gospel of the kingdom are unbelievers or not. Many
believers will accept the foundational gospel of grace but oppose the fuller gospel of the kingdom. But we must
deal appropriately with those who oppose the gospel of the kingdom. We do not jump to the conclusion that they
will go to Hell, for that is a soteriological conclusion. On the other hand, we have substantial grounds to infer that
Presumptive Sainthood                                                                                           Page 16
false misthological teachers will go to the outer darkness, as a misthological conclusion. Jesus, Peter, and Paul
named those opposed to the gospel of the kingdom—so must we. Regardless of their soteriological status, they are
not saints. Misthologically, they are dogs, pigs, and false prophets.
       Opposition to misthology makes one an enemy of misthology, an enemy of the gospel of the kingdom
(cp. Phil 3:18; 2Thess 1:8). Therefore, we must judge with righteous standards and intent. Namely, we must use the
gospel of the kingdom to determine who is teaching in accordance with its precepts. Call out the false teacher—to
protect the immature saints from following such teaching and/or behavior. Call the immature to repentance
(Rev 3:19). Do it by speaking the truth in love (Eph 4:15)—to protect the flock from the wolves—or you become
the fool—thrown out at the Gehenna Bema into the outer darkness. The gospel of the kingdom includes
acknowledging that you put yourself in danger of the outer darkness if you do not use its teaching responsibly in
rebuking those who misconstrue or resist it irresponsibly.
       Jesus says you will know false teachers by their teaching. Anyone teaching that all believers are saints who
inherit the kingdom is a false teacher. They are opposed to the gospel of the kingdom, and they should be opposed
accordingly. The inheritance of the kingdom and thus entrance into its kingship are rewards reserved for faithful
believers. This affirmation is a fundamental tenet of misthology. The more advanced deduction being demonstrated
herein is that faithful believers are the ones who will qualify to retain their saintly status. Dogs, pigs, and wolves in
sheep’s clothing are not considered saints. Do not put a halo on a dog, pig, or wolf in sheep’s clothing. The Bible
does not, and neither should you. The Sermon on the Mount’s beatitudes do not apply to the dogs, pigs, and wolves
described within the Sermon on the Mount. Labeling doggish, piggish, or wolfish teachers as saints would be a
grave injustice to the context.
       Immediately after warning about false teachers in the Sermon, Jesus warns: “Not everyone who says to Me,
‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom or kingship of heaven; but the one who does the will of My Father who is in
heaven” (Mt 7:21; TM). Basileia can mean kingdom or kingship. In this context, it means both. The will of the
Father for kingdom entrance is to believe in Jesus for eternal life as a free gift (Jn 6:40). The will of the Father for
kingship entrance is to embrace the gospel of the kingdom and live and teach accordingly, maximizing their reward
as Jesus expounds throughout the Sermon. Unregenerate false teachers will not enter the kingdom spatially, and
regenerate false teachers will not enter the kingship experientially/regally. Jesus will declare to both types of false
prophets, “I never knew you, depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness” (Mt 7:23). 12 “The law is good, if one
uses it lawfully” (1Tim 1:8). Jesus uses it lawfully in the Sermon on the Mount to show us our soteriological
inadequacy and need of spiritual dependency for kingdom regality. Those who never embrace this duality of the
gospel of the kingdom never attain the intimacy with the Lord obtained by kingdom saints. Mature kingdom
knowledge can only be achieved by adopting the Lord’s dual message of entrance and kingship requirements.

12
   The Sermon on the Mount thus joins the gospel of the kingdom’s soteriological foundation with its
misthological conclusion. Whereas Paul in Gal 3:24 shows that the Law’s first function was to lead us to Christ
for justification, Jesus in Matthew 5–7 lawfully re-employs the fulfilled Law as a training manual for reigning—
guiding saints toward the righteousness that the Spirit produces, not that the flesh performs. The Sermon sets a
standard so high that it drives the faithful to be poor in spirit, learning dependence on the Spirit rather than on a
checklist of rules. In this way, Jesus uses the Law lawfully but never legalistically: as a gracious instrument for
those already justified to pursue their regal inheritance.
        The Sermon on the Mount is saturated with statements and discussions regarding the kingdom/kingship and
rewards. It thus serves as a race manual for kingship, not as a rulebook for justification. It opens (Mt 5:17-20) and
closes (Mt 7:21-23) with the same focus—entrance into the kingship, that is, participation in Christ’s kingship—
forming an inclusio that frames the entire discourse. Jesus “fulfills the Law” by embodying its true intent and using
the Law (nomos) lawfully (nomimos, 1Tim 1:8), showing how those already saved by grace may pursue regal
inheritance. Paul draws the same line when he says that only those who compete lawfully (nomimos) are crowned
(2Tim 2:5). Yet this lawful use of the Law is not legalism.
       Legalism—whether applied to justification or sanctification—trusts in self-effort and external compliance.
Jesus’ high standards are intentionally impossible apart from dependence on the Spirit, driving saints to be “poor in
spirit,” that is, dependent on the Spirit, so that the Spirit may internalize the very righteousness the Sermon demands.
Thus, the Law, fulfilled and animated by the Spirit, becomes the internalized rule of life for reigning, not a checklist
for earning salvation from Hell or even regality. The Sermon’s aim is not to make believers despair under
regulations, but to train them to reign through Spirit-empowered obedience—the lawful use of the Law that leads
to greatness in the kingdom rather than exclusion from its kingship.

                                                 Matthean Epignosis
        Because Jesus never knew (ginosko) these false claimants to kingdom satisfactory performance or prophesy,
Jesus therefore (oun) proceeds to exhort, be a wise man who builds his house upon (epi) “the rock,” namely, “these
words of Mine” (Mt 7:24). These words—His teaching (logos)—constitute misthology, the doctrine of rewards,
that is, the gospel of the kingdom as expounded throughout the Sermon on the Mount. The warning targets false
teachers who unwittingly oppose this gospel, supposing that prophetic activity and impressive works qualify them
for kingdom entrance or privilege (Mt 7:22). Yet all such prophecy and performance lack a sufficient misthological
foundation when not built upon the gospel of the kingdom.
        The building upon (epi) knowing (ginosko)—epi + ginosko—Jesus desires in this context suggests a mature,
experiential understanding of His kingdom teaching. Indeed, Jesus had just stated that we would know (epiginosko)
false prophets by their fruit (Mt 7:16, 20)—that is, by the content and quality of their teaching. Peter picks up on
this connection and uses it in 2Pet 2:21, where mature kingdom believers did not maintain their mature kingdom
knowing (epiginosko) because they were led astray by false teachers. In the preceding verse (2Pet 2:20), Peter uses
the nominal form to describe this mature kingdom knowledge (epignosis). Their fate becomes misthological
hopeless as a result of their fall from this mature kingdom knowledge. The writer of Hebrews likewise says, “For
if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the mature kingdom knowledge [epignosis] of the truth, there no longer
remains a sacrifice for sins” (Heb 10:26). Misthological apostacy on the part of the misthological mature is
irreparable. Jointly, we see that misthological apostasy can be moral, theological, or both. Attaining and maintaining
mature kingdom knowledge is critical.
2Pet 2:20-22

                                         Two Groups of False Teachers
        Peter distinguishes two groups: the false teachers (unregenerate) and the believers they entice. Peter’s
pronouns make it plain: they (the teachers) “will exploit you,” the saved readership (2Pet 2:1-3). Those duped
believers are described as people who have truly escaped the world (2Pet 2:18,20), have washed (2Pet 2:22;
cf. Tit 3:5), and have come to true/mature knowledge—epignosis—of the Lord (2Pet 2:20-21). In other words,
genuinely mature believers can be carried away and fall from their steadfastness (2Pet 3:17; cf. Gal 2:13; 5:4).
When such mature believers persist into what I call mature apostasy—a settled, persevering departure in doctrine
or morals—their last state is worse than their first, not soteriologically, but misthologically (2Pet 2:20–22). They
move from the path of righteousness back to the mire, and their Bema outcome worsens accordingly (Lk 12:47-48).

                                                     Mature Apostasy
       Even though Peter is focused on the moral outcome of this apostasy, one should not suppose that his
assessment is limited to moral apostasy. In other contexts, theological apostasy, which underpins their moral
apostasy, could suffice. This means that theological apostasy alone (even without spectacular moral collapse) can
be misthologically fatal. Wilkin’s “Coffin Zone” (Confident in Christ, 167-168) is an apt analogy that captures the
risk: advanced discipleship raises accountability: “A fall from fifty feet or above is almost always fatal.” The higher
the ascent, the more catastrophic and likely fatal the fall is. In TOD, I argued that Peter’s epignosis/escape/washing
language best describes believers who had matured before defecting. That is the point: mature apostasy is not a
temporary stumble; it is a hardened, persevering departure that voids presumptive sainthood and results in the
outer darkness, even while their regenerate life remains secure. Despite their regenerated-washed nature, Peter
compares such apostates to dogs and pigs. They are saints who have permanently forfeited their presumptive
saint/salt status and traded it in for a presumptive dog/pig status, which will be misthological confirmed at the Bema.

                                              The Way of Righteousness
        These mature believers had escaped worldly defilements through the mature kingdom knowledge that comes
by their having traversed a considerable way on the kingdom highway to glory, called “the way of righteousness,”
which presumptively begins at the point of soteriological faith, when the believer is regenerated and thereby enters
the kingdom (Jn 3:3,5). Yet this entrance is only the starting gate of the journey. From that initial soteriological
faith, the believer is expected to progress and persevere in misthological faith and works, the pathway that leads not
merely to inclusion in the kingdom but to rulership within it.

                                            Old Testament Foundations
       This kingdom highway has its background in the OT. In Proverbs and Isaiah, the “way of righteousness”
denotes more than moral decency; it is the path of wisdom that leads to life beyond death. “In the way [orach] of
righteousness is life, and in its pathway there is no death” (Prov 12:28). Solomon’s usage extends proverbial “life”
beyond temporal well-being to abundant and enduring life—the same misthological life promised to the faithful
who persevere (cf. Prov 14:14,21,24,27; 16:31; 4:9). The “crown” and “fountain of life” motifs anticipate rewarded
immortality rather than mere longevity. Those who fear the Lord and walk in wisdom participate in a pathway that
culminates in radiant honor and knowledge (Prov 14:18; Dan 12:3). 13 The tax collectors and prostitutes thus
believed John’s and Jesus’ proclamation that the long-awaited theocratic kingdom of heaven was at hand
(Mt 3:2; 4:17)—offered nationally to Israel yet open individually to those who would share in its
administration. Their repentance and baptism signified that they embraced this way of righteousness,
positioning themselves not only for entrance into the kingdom but for misthological participation in its
rulership as faithful saints within that coming order. The kingdom/kinship was at hand nationally and
misthologically.

13
   Like many commentators, I view Prov 12:28 (“in the way of righteousness is life”) as expressing a moral
connection between righteousness and life, while recognizing that Solomon’s life often transcends temporal vitality.
As Waltke (NICOT) notes regarding Prov 12:28, the righteous are rewarded with immortality, and wisdom “begins
to break through the limits of this present life, and to announce a life beyond the reach of death.” Likewise, Ps 16:11
(“You will make known to me the path [orach] of life”) extends this way/path of life motif into a misthological
framework of rewarded immortality in the divine Presence (cf. Ps 73:24; Prov 15:24). See Resurrection and Reward
in Proverbs, https://misthology.org/pdf/articles/Resurrection_and_Reward_in_Proverbs.pdf. This OT wisdom
motif regarding the pathway to life is foundational for several NT misthological expressions.
Presumptive Sainthood                                                                                           Page 19
                                                   John and Jesus
       John the Baptist came “in the way of righteousness” (Mt 21:32), calling Israel to repentant obedience and
readiness for the kingdom’s administration. Jesus’ parable of the two sons (Mt 21:28-32) ties belief directly to labor
in the vineyard—belief that manifests in action. Thus, entrance into the kingdom and participation in its kingship
are integrally related: One enters by faith but inherits rulership by faithful labor. Jesus stressed the faith of the tax
collectors and prostitutes in a context dealing with responding correctly to the summons for God’s children to labor
in His vineyard by believing John’s kingdom message about the way of righteousness. Therefore, an appropriate
expanded translation for Mt 21:31, encompassing the full range of meaning, would be: “The tax-gatherers and
harlots will enter the kingdom and kinship of God before you.” 14 Jesus proceeds in this verse to criticize the leaders
for not repenting and believing, both of which go hand in hand, for the kingdom of God being at hand (Mk 1:15).

                                                Apostolic Culmination
       Peter extends the concept from the Gospels into the realm of sanctified perseverance. In 2Pet 2:20-22, the
“way of righteousness” refers not to initial justification but to the mature, sanctified life of those who have truly
“escaped the defilements of the world through the epignosis of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.” These are genuine
believers who have undergone regeneration and cleansing (louo), yet who risk moral apostasy by returning to
corruption. Their state becomes “worse than the first,” not soteriologically (for they remain regenerate) but
misthologically—they forfeit reward and incur punitive darkness. While not the soteriological darkness experienced
by the unregenerate teachers (2Pet 2:17), it is the misthologically correlative outer darkness warned about by Jesus
for the sons of the kingdom who do not follow the way of righteousness in faithful stewardship (Mt 8:12; 22:13;
25:30). The danger is not loss of justification but loss of co-rulership and City citizenship, echoing the warnings of
Hebrews 10:26-39 and the parables of outer darkness.

                                                 Synthetic Trajectory
     From Proverbs through Peter, the way of righteousness is a continuous theological-moral-eschatological
pathway:
              Stage                               Description                                        Outcome
 Soteriological Entrance Faith for regeneration and kingdom access                     Escape from corruption
 Misthological Progress Faith-works perseverance, practical sanctification        Righteous reign and reward
 Apostasy/Regression    Forgetting misthological cleansing, returning to the mire Exclusion, outer darkness
      Thus, the way presumptively begins at saving faith but advances through tested obedience toward glory,
honor, and rulership (2Pet 1:10-11; Phil 3:14). It is a single path with two dimensions—soteriological initiation
and rewardable continuation. Those who remain on it receive the crown of righteousness (2Tim 4:8), while those
who abandon it experience the loss of misthological life, though not the loss of the gift of eternal life itself.


14
   This OT pathway-to-life misthology reappears in Mt 7:13-14 (“the narrow way leading to life”) and Mt 21:32
(“John came in the way of righteousness”). In agreement with most exegetes, I recognize a soteriological foundation
to this imagery—the path begins with regeneration and faith in Christ—but, in keeping with the misthological focus
of the context, I emphasize its misthological nature. Thus, I understand these two Matthean “way” texts as reflecting
a soteric–misthological duality: regeneration provides the entrance into the kingdom, yet perseverance in
righteousness determines participation in the kingship. Some misthologists have likewise noted the misthological
nature of these Matthean texts. However, unlike my misthological peers, I have argued elsewhere (see MMP6) for
an exclusively misthological interpretation of “the way” in Jn 14:6. There, the “way” pertains not to the sinner’s
approach to heaven but to the believer’s moral and relational approach to the Prepared Place in association with
the Father’s House—the Reward City. Jesus prepares a bridal chamber, an upper chamber, for His faithful, saintly
believers. This reading represents a development beyond my earlier writings, in which—like other Free Grace
soteriologists and misthologists—I had previously treated Jn 14:6 as describing a soteriological entrance rather than
a misthological bridal qualification. The regenerate apostates in 2Pet 2:20 fell from this misthological “way of
righteousness” that leads to the kingship, the Father’s House, and the Bridal suite prepared above it.

                                   Final Summary: The Way of Righteousness
       The way of righteousness is the believer’s appropriate theological and moral response to the gospel of the
kingdom. It begins with soteriological faith resulting in regeneration and assuring entrance into the kingdom, but
it must mature into misthological faith and works that qualify one for rulership within that kingdom. Rooted in
OT wisdom and prophetic imagery, it culminates in NT exhortation: a continuous moral trajectory that unites faith,
obedience, and reward. To depart from this way is to forfeit kingdom inheritance and fall into punitive misthological
darkness, but to persevere in this way of life is to obtain the crown of righteousness and share in Christ’s co-
rulership. Thus, the way of righteousness encompasses both the entrance of the regenerate and the exaltation of
the faithful, bridging justification and reward as the single pathway of kingship destiny. The way of righteousness
is the kingdom highway to rulership of the eternal kingdom and is typified by Is 35:8 as the Highway of Holiness
that leads to the City, but it cannot be traversed by the unclean and fools. 15
2Pet 2:9
       As argued in TOD, the fate of these mature apostates will be worse than that of their former immature state—
not worse than that of the false teachers who never knew the Lord (2 Pet 2:20). Peter’s comparison concerns degrees
of loss within the regenerate, not between the regenerate and the unregenerate. Those who once walked the path of
righteousness and then turned from it will suffer a severer misthological recompense (Lk 12:47–48), forfeiting the
crown of righteousness for the stripes of righteousness. The danger, therefore, is that if these mature believers fall
from this tentatively misthologically secure position (2Pet 3:17), their resultant state will be worse—both temporally
and misthologically—than their initial immature state. Falling from maturity into apostasy is worse than the
carnality of immaturity (2Pet 2:20). Peter is not comparing their regenerate state with their previous unregenerate
state but rather contrasting their beginning on this path of qualification for kingdom reward with their subsequent
lapse from it.

  The designation “the Way” (he hodos) in Acts serves as the narrative bridge between the soteriological entrance
into life and the misthological pursuit of kingship. Initially proclaimed as “the way of salvation” (Acts 16:17), it
begins at regeneration, yet baptism immediately follows as a meritorious, public act of allegiance that enrolls the
believer upon the kingdom highway and subjects them to persecution. From that point, believers are summoned to
perseverance, since “through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom [kingship] of God” (Acts 14:22). Luke
joins this Way to the message of the kingdom of God (Acts 19:8-9), to persecution for adherence to it (Acts 22:4),
and to moral accountability at the resurrection (Acts 24:14-15), echoing Daniel 12’s distinction between those raised
to glory and those to shame. Thus, the Way functions as the lived trajectory of following Jesus—the moral and
misthological path of discipleship leading to regal inheritance. Both Lordship-Salvation and Free-Grace
interpreters, though differing on soteriology, agree that following Christ concerns perseverance and reward;
therefore, the Way in Acts naturally encompasses the same reward economy. Entrance is by faith; progress is by
faithful obedience; consummation is by shining participation in the kingship.

        Other misthologists have made similar analyses. However, as a tentative proposal, I would allow that the
worse state of these mature apostates may also entail exclusion from the Bride’s rapture participation, so that these
apostates are left behind to face the temporal fires of the Day of the Lord. In that sense, their temporal fall anticipates
an eschatological punishment proportionate to the maturity they have forfeited. Just as there will be degrees of
misthological glory among the saints, there will be degrees of misthological shame among apostates. Although no
major partial-rapture expositor to my knowledge (Govett, Lang, Panton, Nee, etc.) appears to have applied
2Pet 2:20–22 directly to selective translation, my treatment of 2 Thessalonians makes me alert to that possibility.
        Paul says, “When the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven,” He will deal “out retribution to those who do not
know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus” (2Thess 1:7-8). In that context, Paul is
describing the potential misthological worthiness of the Thessalonians to inherit the kingdom/kingship
(2Thess 1:5) as a result of their present suffering, so as to be glorified as saints and marveled at by believers
(2Thess 1:10). The subject is obedience to the gospel of the kingdom. In the next chapter, Paul immediately warns
of an outbreak of apostasy associated with the Day of the Lord, and of judgment upon all who refuse to love and
believe this gospel of misthological salvation and glory (2Thess 2:12). Believers who turn from that gospel appear
to fall within the scope of that retributive punishment.
        Peter commends Paul’s writings as Scripture (2Pet 3:14-16) and seems to read from the same playbook. Peter
begins on the same note by describing the believer’s hope of obtaining a misthological inheritance—the salvation
of the soul—through perseverance in trials (1Pet 1:3-13). Hence, believers are to conduct themselves in godly fear
(1Pet 1:17). Peter further speaks of their presumptive royalty (1Pet 2:9) and the fiery testing of righteous suffering
(1Pet 4:12-16), concluding that “it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God” (1Pet 4:17-18). The
“difficulty” by which the righteous are being saved in this context is their endurance of suffering for misthological
glory; the salvation in view is also misthological. Thus, Peter’s contrasts are not soteriological but misthological.
        In his second epistle, Peter resumes the theme: apply all diligence to cultivate godly character to secure a rich
entrance into the everlasting kingdom/kingship (2 Pet 1:3-11). Like Paul, Peter warns that false teachers will arise
and lead many astray. Yet he declares, “The Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation, and to keep the
unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment” (2 Pet 2:9). The godly are those who live in obedience to
the gospel of the kingdom despite present hardship. Contrary to some commentators, Peter is not guaranteeing the
perseverance of all believers but distinguishing the delivered godly from apostates who fall. The “unrighteous under
punishment” parallels Paul’s warning that those who do not obey the gospel of the kingdom remain under divine
discipline associated with the Day of the Lord (2Thess 1:5; 2:12).
        God knows how to rescue righteous believers like Lot while simultaneously allowing those believers who
look back, like Lot’s wife, to experience the temporal judgment coming upon the ungodly. Partial-rapturists often
take Lot as a type of the Rapture, though they usually fail to note the selective aspect implied by the story in this
context to apostates. If 2Pet 2:9 indeed alludes to the Day of the Lord rather than the Great White Throne, it stands
in close parallel with Paul’s framework. In that case, the situation of mature apostates is even worse than that of
immature carnal believers. Mature apostates are subject to the temporal wrath of the Day of the Lord when left
behind at the Rapture, followed by misthological punishment when they stand before Christ at a post-mortem Bema.
The passage’s logic of relapse and forfeiture fits naturally within this structure. The suggestion that their worse state
could include tribulational retribution preceding misthological retribution is therefore a new yet textually coherent
line of inference.
1Pet 1:3-5
       Peter says our inheritance is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, reserved in heaven and guarded by
God’s power through faith. Arminian and Calvinist readers typically treat that reservation as soteriological—kept
safe for final salvation by perseverance in faith. But in both systems, perseverance in faith becomes the instrumental
condition of escaping the Lake of Fire. Since perseverance is a rewardable action, it is a work; making final salvation
depend on it is, at bottom, an accursed works-conditioned soteriology.
       Some punctiliar-faith securitists try to avoid that accursed soteriology by shrinking the faith in view to a past
moment. The context will not allow it. The “faith” here is tested faith (1Pet 1:7), tried under fire and proved precious,
resulting “in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ”—so that they are rewarded with the
salvation of their souls (1:9). In Scripture, that expression never denotes a soteriological acquittal; it is
misthological, bound to evaluation and reward.
       Thus, the only model that does justice to Peter’s flow is Presumptive Misthology. The inheritance is truly
reserved—but reserved presumptively for believers at regeneration. From that moment, we are enrolled as heirs,
Presumptive Sainthood                                                                                           Page 22
and God’s power guards the reservation as we walk by faith. The realization, however, remains conditioned on
perseverance. The reward itself is eternal once received, but the reservation is not necessarily eternal for those
who never come into possession. Jesus’ command, “Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven” (Mt 6:20),
presupposes both accrual and risk: you can deposit richly—and you can forfeit prospective inheritance by
unfaithfulness before the finish. Mature believers, having laid up much, stand to inherit much; but precisely for that
reason, they also have the most to lose if they fail to endure. God supplies the power to prevail; we must avail
ourselves of that empowerment.
Mt 8:11-12
         In Mt 13:30,38, the sons of the kingdom are described as the good seed that produces wheat and are gathered
into the barn, Heavenly Jerusalem (the Reward City). However, in Mt 8:12 the sons of the kingdom are cast into
the outer darkness, thus into the kingdom parameter outside the Reward City. They are still called sons to underscore
that their presumptive inheritance rights were revoked. Likewise, the man in Mt 22:12 is still called a “friend,” even
though he is cast into the outer darkness (Mt 22:13). He lost the intimacy associated with the term. The servant cast
into the outer darkness in Mt 25:30 is still called a servant even though he did not serve. He lost the talent and
opportunity to serve. In various ways, these believers lost what they had, even though the term was still retained.
Therefore, presumptive misthology does not necessarily require revoking the term itself. In some cases, stripping
the title of its meaning suffices. The retention of the designation underscores the misthological connection and
loss. 16 However, in other cases, such as the term “saint,” the title is revoked to emphasize the privilege’s revocation.
1Pet 5:1,10
        This article has explored the concept of presumptive sainthood—the initial, untested state of holiness that
believers possess by virtue of their faith. Yet, as demonstrated herein, presumptive sainthood is not a final verdict.
It is a provisional status that can be lost, confirmed, or denied at the Bema. However, the goal of mature misthology
is to move beyond this provisional state and attain confirmed sainthood—a state of misthological assurance that
is firm, secure, and ideally reached before death.

  Additionally, in the case of Mt 22:12, the designation friend differentiates his misthological carelessness from
the soteriological and misthological hostility and indifference of those described in Mt 22:7. Possibly, regenerate
misthological enemies of the gospel might be left behind at the Rapture to experience temporal destruction as a
precursor to their misthological destruction and thus suffer God’s wrath in two capacities (cp. Lk 19:27). In short,
the Rapture may not distinguish between unregenerate and regenerate false teachers and allow the latter to be
condemned along with the world in participating in God’s DOL wrath (cp. 1Cor 11:32).
Presumptive Sainthood                                                                                             Page 23
       This firm assurance trajectory is exemplified in 1Pet 5:1-10, where Peter speaks not merely as a hopeful
believer but as one who has endured suffering and now partakes in the glory to be revealed. He is not speaking of
presumptive holiness or presumptive sainthood in this context. He has moved beyond presumptive sainthood to
permanent, confirmed sainthood in this closing chapter. He has transitioned from presumption to confirmation.
Likewise, Paul’s declaration in 2Tim 4:7-8—“I have fought the good fight…there is laid up for me the crown of
righteousness”—is not spoken from a place of uncertainty. It is the voice of a man whose sainthood has been
confirmed. The groundwork for reaching these conclusions was laid in the series of YouTube videos Misthological
Fear and Assurance. That groundbreaking study laid the foundation for asserting that presumptive sainthood has
the potential to become confirmed permanent sainthood before death for mature misthologists. And Peter invites us
to reach that state of maturity in this context.
       Key arguments from those videos as applied to the current study include:

     •   The Problem of False Assurance: Many believers mistake presumptive sainthood for
         confirmed holiness, leading to spiritual complacency and vulnerability at the Bema.
     •   Fighting and Balancing Fear: Misthological fear is not a contradiction to assurance—it is a
         necessary tension that guides believers toward endurance and fruitfulness.
     •   Transitional Forms of Misthological Fear: These presentations explore how fear evolves as
         believers mature, helping them navigate the risks of spiritual loss.
     •   Stop-Loss Strategies for Heavenly Stock: Using financial metaphors, these videos illustrate
         how believers can guard their spiritual investments and avoid catastrophic losses. When the
         strategies in that series are applied to the current study, they enable a mature believer to move
         from presumptive sainthood to permanent sainthood even before reaching the Bema.

       Those YouTube presentations provided detailed exegesis, theological models, and practical applications that
support the claim herein that by default presumptive sainthood is a beginning, not a guarantee. However, the mature
believer can move beyond the presumptive state to the confirmed state by implementing that advanced misthological
model. The believer’s journey must move toward confirmation, whether at the Bema or before death. Peter, Paul,
and Abraham are examples of those who reached this state before their earthly lives ended.
       This present article serves as a summary of the presumptive model and an invitation to the confirmation
model. For those seeking deeper understanding, verification, and theological grounding, the full presentations are
available in my YouTube playlist. That series provides the scriptural scaffolding and doctrinal clarity necessary to
grasp the full weight of this argument.
       In closing, the purpose of these series is not merely academic—it is pastoral. It is a call to mature in
misthological holiness, to pursue a life that is misthologically secure, and to follow the path of Peter and Paul toward
confirmed sainthood before death.
                                        Conclusion: A Call to Faithfulness
       Presumptive sainthood motivates holiness without compromising grace. All believers are positionally
sanctified (1Cor 6:11) and presumptively qualified as saints to inherit the kingdom (Dan 7:18,22), but only faithful
believers ultimately shine as saints (Dan 12:3). Unfaithful believers forfeit this status. Still, they do not forfeit their
salvation from the Lake of Fire. This synthesis refines TOD’s positional view and DSAS’s duality, offering a
misthological lens in which the Bema separates “well done” (Mt 25:23, NAS) from loss (1Cor 3:15). Stand firm to
retain your place in the Reward City and eat from the Tree of Life that grows there.
       The term holy ones is used of both angels and humans in the Scripture. Holy angels who fell are no longer
considered holy. Likewise, humans who fall or fail to progress or preserve in holiness are no longer considered holy
ones. Continuing to call them saints is a misnomer. They remained sanctified as God’s possession, but they are no
longer His treasured possession in the misthological sense (cp. Is 43:21; Mal 3:17; 1Pet 2:9) who qualify for the
kingdom possession. In the end, Bridal saints will be the only believers who retain their saintly status. 17 All believers

  My earlier analysis may be tweaked to allow that all believers are special treasure presumptively rather than
soteriologically: https://misthology.org/pdf/articles/Hidden_Ones.pdf. In Hidden Ones (2015), I described believers
as God’s “special treasure” in a soteric-mistholic duality—already His possession by grace yet potentially His
Presumptive Sainthood                                                                                       Page 24
are presumptive treasure at conversion; only the faithful are actual treasure at the Bema, which cleanly absorbs
and supersedes my earlier soteric dimension.

        Although beyond the scope of the current study, Peter’s exhortation to “do your best to make your calling
and election secure” through growth and perseverance in practical holiness (2Pet 1:10; TM) was found to dovetail
with an earlier study to conclude that confirmed misthological holiness and thus sainthood are attainable even before
death by those who embrace the gospel of the kingdom and mature thereby. Jesus warned that “many are called,
but few are chosen [elected; eklektos]” (Mt 22:14). The preface ek (out of) makes those chosen a subset of those
called. Therefore, ensure that you are among the chosen/elected in the end, not merely among those who responded
to the initial call to the Way of Righteousness in the beginning. Secure your presumptive call with an eschatological
election.

treasure by reward. Under the framework of presumptive misthology (MMP7), this duality is refined into a single
misthological continuum: all believers are presumptively God’s treasure at conversion, but only the faithful retain
that status at the Bema. The earlier soteriological layer is now understood as presumptive grace within a reward
context, not as a second, separate category of treasure.
