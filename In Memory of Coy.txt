                                               Introduction
       My older son, Jeremy, and his wife, Lindsi, had been joyfully preparing for their first child, who was to be
the first grandchild for me and my wife, Dianne. With only two weeks to go before the due date, we were looking
forward to Lindsi’s appointment with the doctor later that day, Tuesday, 4/21/2020.
       Jeremy had been reading a variety of Christian books on how to be a good parent in preparation. He also had
been doing a modified fast for some time, not eating desserts, not even those pink doughnuts from Dunkin’ he loves
so much. He and I had stripped the old carpet out of their house and stained the hardwood floors in preparation for
the big day, thinking this might help remove any potential allergens. With the help of one of Lindsi’s friends, Jeremy
had prepared the nursery, while at the same time keeping the gender of the child a secret at Lindsi’s request. Neither
she nor we had seen inside the nursery or knew the gender. We wanted it to be a surprise, so we did not open the
nursery door. With two weeks to spare, everything was ready for the surprise on the expected due date. Then, that
morning, Dianne and I received a text from Jeremy at 7:40 AM, stating the following:

             Lindsi woke me up at 3 am and said she couldn’t feel the baby moving. So we came to the
      hospital. After the doctors checked her, we learned that we had a miscarriage [fetal demise]. The issue
      is we have to go through labor because the baby was so far along. With Lindsi's platelets so low, they
      are thinking about sending us to Mission [Hospital] for the delivery. Please pray for Lindsi's safety.
      You can tell the family; we just didn’t want to send it in a big group message. We know in this storm,
      Jesus is in our boat. I’ll keep you updated but please pray for Lindsi.1

                                          Jesus in Our Boat
       Jeremy’s statement about having Jesus in their boat was an allusion to our family worship two days earlier,
Sunday evening, 4/19/2020. Because of Covid-19, Jeremy and Lindsi, my brother, Phil, and his family, as well as
Dianne and I had not been able to attend our respective churches for several weeks. Consequently, I had suggested
that we meet for family worship and proposed that I would lead the Lord’s Supper and Phil would lead the worship
time. Because of Covid-19, the church I attend had moved to online worship, and I was teaching our Sunday School
class online for our church on Sunday mornings. Phil, however, was not teaching his Sunday School class for his
church online during this time, so he would have time to present his lessons for us in a family worship. Thus, we
had started meeting at his house for a small, informal, family worship on Sunday evenings. We had met for three
weeks.
       Phil was presenting a series entitled, In Times Like These. The Covid-19 situation was a catalyst for the series,
naturally, but the lessons were not limited to that application. The first lesson, on Sunday 4/5/2020, dealt with the
bondage of the children of Israel in Egypt and with appropriate and inappropriate groanings when suffering. God
had told the children of Israel in advance that they would suffer and promised them eventual deliverance
(Gen 15:13-14). They groaned while suffering, and God heard them, which was an appropriate form of groaning
(Ex 2:24-25; 6:5). Crying out to God while suffering is not only permissible but commendable. But crying out at
God by complaining is contemptable (Num 14:27). When suffering, we need to practice the right kind of groaning.
Such was the gist of the first lesson. Now, as seen in retrospect, both the lesson and it’s timing were very providential
in preparing for the days ahead.
       The second lesson, on Sunday 4/12/2020, dealt with God’s test of Abraham when God told Abraham to
sacrifice his only son (Gen 22:1-2). Based on God’s previous promises, Abraham could deduce that, if God had
him follow through on the sacrifice of his son, God would raise his son from the dead (Heb 11:17-19). Phil pointed
out that we, likewise, must trust and obey God, regardless of the cost of the sacrifice, knowing that we too will be
rewarded. Our families are well versed in the biblical difference between a gift and a reward. We know that we are
going to Heaven simply because we have believed in Jesus for eternal life (Jn 3:16; 1Tim 1:16). We are saved from
Hell by Jesus’ sacrifice for us, not by our sacrifice for Him. On the other hand, we know equally well that our
subsequent sacrifice for Jesus, after receiving eternal life as a free gift, will result in an eternal reward. Thus, Phil

 Personal correspondence, 4/21/2020. The text messages and emails have been given only minor corrections. In
his text, Jeremy said, “Miscarriage.” Technically, though, the term miscarriage only applies for the first twenty
weeks. The technical term is fetal demise resulting in a stillbirth thereafter.
Page 4                                                                                               In Memory of Coy
did not have to elaborate on such basic distinctions in our study. Nevertheless, I point out this distinction for readers
who may not be fortunate enough to attend Bible studies where this distinction is clearly and consistently made. In
our discussion after the lesson, I pointed out that our obedience to God’s will should be such that, like Abraham,
we would accept God’s will even if it should mean the loss of our son. Little did I know that in nine days I would
be faced with this test: Would I accept God’s will even regarding the death of my only grandchild—my only
grandson? Likewise, would my firstborn son, Jeremy, who was sitting across from me on Phil’s couch when I made
that statement, be willing and able to accept God’s will even regarding the death of his only son, which was to occur
in just nine days? We had no choice as to whether we would be tested and whether we would groan, but we did
have a choice as to which type of groans we would make—to God or at God. Our wives would be faced with the
same test. Crying was to come, and a lot of it. But was it to be crying out to God or a crying out against Him?
        The third lesson, on Sunday 4/19/2020, dealt with the storm on the sea when the disciples were crossing the
sea with Jesus. The account is provided by three of the gospel writers, and Phil discussed it from their three different
vantage points. For summary purposes, we will just look at one:
         35
         And on that day, when evening had come, He said to them, “Let us go over to the other side.” 36 And
      leaving the multitude, they took Him along with them, just as He was, in the boat; and other boats were
      with Him. 37 And there arose a fierce gale of wind, and the waves were breaking over the boat so much
      that the boat was already filling up. 38 And He Himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and
      they awoke Him and said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?” 39 And being
      aroused, He rebuked the wind and said to the sea, “Hush, be still.” And the wind died down and it
      became perfectly calm. 40 And He said to them, “Why are you so timid? How is it that you have no
      faith?” 41 And they became very much afraid and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the
      wind and the sea obey Him?” (Mk 4:36-41; cp. Mt 8:23-27; Lk 8:22-25)

With his typical skill, Phil made an insightful play on words to distinguish our vantage points from God’s advantage
point. As demonstrated in the first lesson regarding groaning and crying, calling upon the Lord can likewise be done
in an admirable or reproachable fashion. We can either call upon the Lord in faith, or we can call upon Him in
doubt. These disciples obviously called upon the Lord in doubt and earned His reproach as a result. In the middle
of the storm, the disciples questioned Jesus: “Do You not care?” Many believers, likewise, in the middle of their
storms, cry out to God: “Do you not care?” Alternatively, I might interject, we can call on the Lord in faith and earn
His praise as a meritable result (Mt 8:5-13), resulting in His praise as our reward.2 Phil exhorted us to call upon the
Lord in faith, trusting in God’s advantage point over our vantage point, believing that God has a purpose in the
storm even though we cannot perceive His intention from our limited vantage point.
        Two nights later, the storm hit. Jeremy and Lindsi were hit by the greatest storm of their lives. Even for
weathered seafarers like Dianne and me, this was no small storm. Still, I knew that my faith and Dianne’s faith
would hold. Over the years we have had a lot of practice trusting the Lord amidst life’s difficulties and have learned
to depend upon the Lord by the power of His Spirit. But how well would our children do?
        Dianne and I raised our children to love and trust the Lord from the time they were born. We never wanted
them to know a day when they did not love and trust the Lord. They believed in the Lord for eternal life as children.
Lindsi, on the other hand, did not become a believer until she was in college. Had her faith grown sufficiently for
the trial before her? We know that God does not place believers in greater trials than their faith in Him can bear—
if they will trust Him (1Cor 10:13)—but we also know that we cannot take our perseverance in faith for granted.
The Bible promises believers unconditional security, not unconditional faith. Perseverance in faith is not
unconditionally guaranteed. Some believers falter in the faith or completely fail in the faith rather than trust the
Lord in faith when their faith is put to the fiery test. Weak faith can faint in the day of adversity (Prov 24:10).
        I was in a state of shock as I read Jeremy’s text about the baby’s death. I showed the text to Dianne. Our
shock quickly gave way to tears, prayers, and texts. We live in Sylva, NC. They were going to take Lindsi via an
ambulance to Mission Hospital in Asheville, about an hour’s drive away, because Mission had better medical care
for her condition. Jeremy was going follow in his car. As broken as our hearts were, we knew that Jeremy and
Lindsi were bearing the brunt of the impact. We offered to drive Jeremy, but he declined, saying, “I could use some
air.” With the Covid-19 restrictions, Dianne and I were not allowed in our local hospital or in the Asheville hospital

 Some believers have a theological issue with the concept of merit. For a theological defense of various types of
biblical merit, see my book, Mere Christianity and Moral Christianity.

to see them. Consequently, we could only communicate with them via texts. We grieved at not being able to be with
them and put our arms around them. We prayed that they would sense God’s arms around them in our place, that
God would keep them safe, and that He would strengthen their faith.

                                                   The Wait
        Our texts that Tuesday morning ended in that state. Dianne and I took the day off from work. Basically, we
spent the morning in a state of shock, with tears streaming as we wept and prayed. We also notified some immediate
family members and close friends so that they could join us in prayer. I had a virtual meeting for work scheduled
at 11:00 that I attended long enough to give my report, but I cut my time short, informing my coworkers that my
brother was coming by to pray for us during his lunch break. Phil and Susanne, his wife, came to pray with us. We
talked shortly. Dianne and I did not know any more than what few details Jeremy had shared in his texts, which I
have already shared with you herein.
        Phil prayed a great prayer for us. He and Dianne kept saying something that I could only partially relate to
from one vantage point, however, but not from another vantage point. In my biblical studies, I have often found that
Scripture presents various truths from different vantage points. Take, for example, eternal life. About half the time,
eternal life is a free gift (e.g., Rom 6:23). About the other half of the time, it is a costly reward (e.g., Gal 6:8). Many
people misconstrue these two vantage points into one and think that the free gift of eternal life is a costly reward.
Nothing could be further from the truth! Simply, the Scripture is talking about two different aspects of eternal life.
The gift aspect of eternal life is given to you simply for believing in Jesus for this gift and results in unconditional
security in terms of reaching Heaven. The reward aspect of eternal life is an abundant experience of eternal life
frequently associated with eternal rewards in Heaven, such as having the crown of life or eating from the tree of
life, both of which are enhanced experiences of eternal life promised to those believers who overcome the trials in
their lives and persevere in the faith. So, persevering in the faith has eternal repercussions and is extremely
important, which is one reason Dianne and I were praying for Jeremy and Lindsi regarding their faith. Other reasons
to persevere could be given, to be sure, but this eternal-reward concern is certainly an especially important one.
        Such basic distinctions as these vantage points regarding eternal life are very elementary for well-versed
believers such as Phil, me, and our wives. Even so, the point raised repeatedly by Phil and Dianne pertained to the
question, “Why did God allow this stillborn death to happen?” In Dianne’s phone calls that day to friends and
family, she repeatedly said, “I know that we are not supposed to ask why, but….” Dianne would go on to explain
that even when she had faced stage-3 breast cancer four years earlier, she did not ask, “Why?” Neither did I. Cancer
was a hard test to be sure, but we both took it as falling within the normal course of possible trials that befall fallen
humans, Christians included. A passage such as that provided by Peter would apply:
       12
         Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing,
       as though some strange thing were happening to you; 13 but to the degree that you share the sufferings
       of Christ, keep on rejoicing; so that also at the revelation of His glory, you may rejoice with exultation.
       (1Pet 4:12-13)

Suffering such trials is not to be considered strange. Why does Peter say to rejoice in our suffering? Is he exhorting
us to be masochists? No. He explains why in his opening salutation: “In this you greatly rejoice, even though now
for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, that the proof of your faith, being more
precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and
honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ” (1Pet 1:6-7). In other words, a faith that passes the fiery test is proven
valuable and meritorious in terms of rewards, that is, enhanced experiences of eternal life, which Peter describes as
the salvation of the soul (1Pet 1:9). Your soul is going to really live it up in Heaven if you persevere in faith during
your trials down here on Earth. The opening verses from James expresses a similar vantage point about rejoicing
during our trials for similar reasons:
       2
        Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, 3 knowing that the testing of your
       faith produces endurance. 4 And let endurance have its perfect result, that you may be perfect and
       complete, lacking in nothing. (Jam 1:2-4)

James goes on to provide a principle reason for rejoicing and persevering during your trials: “Blessed is a man who
Page 6                                                                                               In Memory of Coy
perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised
to those who love Him” (Jam 1:12). The crown of life, that is, an enhanced experience of eternal life as a reward,
is at stake. Not all believers will persevere when their faith is tried. Not all believers will continue to love the Lord
when He allows their faith to be tried. But great rewards await those believers who, despite their trials, persevere in
their faith in the Lord and in their love for the Lord. We are not expected to enjoy the trials, but we are expected to
rejoice in view of the great value our perseverance in faith accrues in terms of rewards. Such teachings are extremely
basic to our theological outlook. So, we did not really have any reason to ask the why question when Dianne faced
cancer.
        This biblical outlook does not belittle that test of our faith, however. Simply, the why question was not an
added obstacle that we had to face during that trial. Instead, I had to wrestle with the what-if question. What would
happen to my relationship with Dianne if she were to die from the cancer? Would my relationship with her dissolve?
Would we just be friends in Heaven? Would I be in the eternal-friend-zone? If so, being in an eternal-friend-zone
was not something to which I was looking forward, even if it was in Heaven. The thought of Heaven seemed to be
a letdown in that regard, and I could not see how rewards in Heaven were really going to make up for my
disappointment in that aspect. Consequently, Dianne’s cancer motivated me to do a lot of biblical research into that
what-if-question and write a book in which I came to conclude that we would not be stuck in an eternal-friend-zone
if we persevered. Instead, we could be rewarded with an eternal monogamous relationship.3
        When presented with trials, I tend to research the matter from a biblical perspective and share my findings in
a book. This present trial regarding the stillbirth is no exception. The catalyst for this book is Dianne’s why question.
She kept saying, “I know that we are not supposed to ask why, but….” And I did not understand why she repeatedly
made this statement because, in contrast, I did ask, “Why?” Yes, I dared to ask the why question. Why not?
        Granted, Phil’s very insightful and heartfelt prayer expressed Dianne’s vantage point as well: We cannot
understand why God would allow the stillbirth, but we trust in God’s goodness and provision regardless. From one
vantage point, I certainly share their perspective. However, I was also perceiving a second vantage point, and doing
so made that part of the trial easier. My second vantage point gave me an immediate answer as to why God allowed
the stillbirth. I could dimly see a partial answer (1Cor 13:9,12), and it helped. I am writing this book to share that
answer with you.

                                                Thank Him
       After Phil had prayed, and while we were still sitting in our living room talking afterward, we got a text from
Jeremy giving us an update, telling us that they were going to do one more ultrasound and were still working toward
inducing labor. I choked up on tears when I saw the text and passed the phone to Dianne so that she could read it to
Phil and Susanne. Before they left, I wanted to lead in another prayer. Before praying, I pointed out that our dad
had stressed the importance of giving thanks for all things because Scripture teaches us to do so: “always giving
thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father” (Eph 5:20). So, my prayer, while
choking on my tears, was simply, “Lord, we still trust You. We still love You. And I give You thanks for our baby’s
death.” Over the years, I have learned to give thanks for all things: big things and little things, bad things and good
things.
       I mentioned one of my favorite verses that helps provide a rationale for doing so: “We know that God causes
all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose”
(Rom 8:28). This verse is a bedrock verse upon which you can build your hope and trust. Since Jeremy, Lindsi,
Dianne, and I love the Lord, I could be absolutely certain that God had good reasons for allowing this tragedy and
that we could trust Him to work it for our good. Another popular verse in this regard is: “‘For I know the plans that
I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope”
(Jer 29:11). I would trust His plan. We are not expected to like the painful parts of His plan or enjoy the pain, but
we are called upon to love Him, trust His plan, and give thanks. So I did so.
       When Phil and Susanne left, Dianne and I watched various inspirational movies she had recorded from UPtv.
Normally, while watching such movies, we might shed a few tears at the end; however, given our emotional state
at the time, we were shedding tears at various points all along the way. At 3:2 PM, we received this text from
Jeremy:

Dealing with Stillbirth                                                                                          Page 7
             Hey Dad, just wanted to give you an update. We are at Mission in Asheville. Lindsi rode the
      ambulance, and I followed (just for the record I arrived basically right after she did). She got some
      medicine to help her get dilated, so her cramps have gotten a bit more intense. There is another form
      of pain med that she can take instead of the epidural which is safer to my knowledge. It’s just getting
      to the labor part that could take a little bit. Please pray for a smooth delivery as that will be a big step
      to rest and healing. Even though this is tough, we have been shown grace and love from the nurses
      breaking rules and hugging us, to texts, emails from multiple states. When we found out our son went
      on home, it was a sadness of missing him but not weeping as those without hope. We know we will
      see him in a minute. I’ve learned that my wife is the strongest person I know. She is a Proverbs 31
      woman without a doubt. We know that good will come of this. God is good, and all the time God is
      good. We love you guys.

Jeremy’s reference about not weeping as those without hope was, of course, a reference to 1Thess 4:13-14: “But
we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve, as do the rest
who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who
have fallen asleep in Jesus.” His grief was tempered with knowledge that he would see his son in Heaven, which he
alluded to as see him in a minute. Dianne and I were very thankful to hear his affirmation of Lindsi experiencing
the Lord’s strengthening and Jeremy’s own affirmation of faith that God would work good out of this experience,
as promised in Rom 8:28, and that God is good, as stressed in the God’s Not Dead movies.

                                                  Emotions
       A potential misperception may need to be addressed for the sake of some readers, though. Some Christians
have a misperception as to what it means to “be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of His might” (Eph 6:10).
Some people think being strong means to keep a stiff upper lip and suppress all sorrowful emotions. We do not
share that perspective. Last year I wrote a book entitled, Degrees of Love and Forgiveness (DLAF), which deals
with the role of emotions and uses the following illustration:
                                           Illustration 1. Neurotic Train




As explained therein, neurotics allow their feelings to determine what they believe. If, for example, they feel like
God does not care, then they believe that God does not care. They allow their feelings to determine what they
believe. The fact of the case, however, is that “God cares for you” (1Pet 5:7), especially for those believers who
love the Lord (see DLAF).
                                            Illustration 2. Biblical Train




A biblical orientation, however, submits our feelings to biblical facts. For instance, we would continue to believe
that God cares for us, even when, at that particular moment, we may feel that He does not care. Grieving at this
time was biblically appropriate. There is “a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance”
(Ecc 3:4). At the appropriate time, at the death of His friend, “Jesus wept” (Jn 11:35). Even God cries with us and
for us when it is appropriate to do so. “The Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words”
(Rom 8:26). At several points, after hearing about the stillbirth, I just simply sobbed, and, with this verse in mind,
allowed the Spirit to share in and convey my groanings to the Father. The sobs were my prayer. There was no need
to try to put my thoughts and feelings into words. I could trust the Spirit to convey the depth of my pain without
trying to put it into words. Those emotions were not wrong whatsoever, and they were expressed in line with biblical
factual data. I could cry out to God, rather than at God, because I know He cares.

                                        Infants in Heaven
       One movie Dianne and I watched that afternoon after Phil and Susanne left was a rerun of Heaven is For
Real. This is the movie we were watching when we received Jeremy’s text at 3:2 PM. We had seen the movie years
before, and I had written an analysis of it in my book dealing with near-death experiences of Heaven: Misthological
Models Part 4: Extrabiblical and Biblical Experiences of Heaven (MMP4). I interact with various experiences of
Heaven in MMP4. Below is a snippet from one of the illustrations of that book which would be especially
appropriate for the present discussion:
                                          Illustration 3. Infant Paradise




Many reports affirm that infants are taken to Heaven and raised in a very loving environment. Some reports indicate
that infants who die are taken to Infant Paradise, which is a large domed city inside New Jerusalem. In my writings,
I pose that those below the age of accountability are taken to Heaven and raised there, where they naturally become
believers in Christ for eternal life.
        Dianne said that perhaps we should not watch Heaven is For Real that evening because we were already
crying as it was, watching the other UPtv movies, and we knew that this movie would be particularly moving
because it deals with a young boy named Colton who had a near-death experience and went to Heaven and met his
sister there—a sister who had died in a miscarriage. That detail we remembered. As we watched the movie, other
pertinent details we had forgotten emerged. Colton knew nothing about this sister until he arrived in Heaven. Later,
he informs his mother that he had met this miscarried sister in Heaven. Not until this point in the movie did his
mother believe that her son actually had been to Heaven in his near-death experience. His mother asked him, What
was the name of your sister? Colton responded that she did not have a name because his parents never gave her a
name. Her mother affirmed that this was accurate. Because of the miscarriage, they had never given her a name.
        We had not yet reached that point in the movie about their miscarried child being nameless when we received
Jeremy’s text. We just recalled that the movie dealt with miscarriage. We had reached the point in the movie,
however, where the little boy said that while he was in Heaven, His grandfather held him in his lap. Of course,
Dianne and I were crying as Colton said that in the movie. So, when I received Jeremy’s text, I paused the movie
and sent him this text:

              Hey son, we are watching Heaven is For Real, where the little boy will go to Heaven and see
      his little sister who had died in a miscarriage, and they will meet in Heaven. It occurred to me, while
      we were watching it, that our little grandson is now in Heaven and my dad and Dianne’s dad and mom
      are getting to hold him before we do. What is the name of our grandson? We love you and are praying
      for you.
Dealing with Stillbirth                                                                                         Page 9
While I was typing that text, I paused when I asked the question. The initial wording that came to my mind
was: “What was the name of our grandson?” That expression of the question certainly conveyed how I felt.
What would his name have been if they had an opportunity to name him—an opportunity that was now gone
forever? But faith in the facts of Scripture caused me to reword my question to: “What is the name of our
grandson?” I changed it from the past tense to the present tense. Our grandson was still very much alive—in
Heaven—and having a name would still be valid. I wanted to know what to call him. Jeremy responded that
he and Lindsi were

      still going back and forth on the name, but I’ll let you know. I think I have it but just want to double
      check with Lindsi. She is asleep kind of. I think she decided to hold him after delivery, so if that stays
      the same, I’m sure I will get a picture.

       I had forgotten the details in the movie about the miscarried child not having a name in Heaven because her
parents had not given her a name because of the early miscarriage. But we had waited so long and only had two
weeks to go before our late term stillbirth. I simply wanted to know my grandson’s name because we had looked
forward to learning his name and gender when he was born. And now, I at least wanted to be able to provide my
grief with a name. Only afterward did it occur to me that, in the Lord’s providential timing, He was having me
watch a movie about the appropriateness of having such a name at the very time that Jeremy and Lindsi were still
trying to finalize that name. The Lord’s providential timing was a little touch of Heaven. Dianne responded to
Jeremy’s text by saying, “We wish we were there holding all of you. Please send a picture. Love you, mom.” Dianne
and I spent the rest of the evening awaiting further word, finishing watching the Heaven is For Real movie, and
then watching some other UPtv movies as we wept.

                                     Jeremy’s Poetic Email
      The next morning, we saw that we had received this text from Jeremy at 1:47 AM:

      Hey guys I sent an email and a picture for you to read in the morning if you want. Lindsi delivered the
      baby tonight :) she is safe, the Lord blessed! Just take a look at the email.

       If you want?!?! Dianne had been asking me all through the previous evening if she should text to see if there
were any further developments. Needless to say, we eagerly looked for the email and the picture. I share this with
you now, with the title Jeremy provided for it the following day, April Showers, which was fitting since this stillbirth
took place in April. The background information I shared with you earlier regarding Phil’s series entitled, In Times
Like These, was necessary so that you would have the context of Jeremy’s poetic email. The ellipses are his, and
the song within it were part of his email.
                                                    April Showers
       In Times like these...people are elated that a family member is added to the clan…a new member that will
always be a fan.
       In times like these...preparation of nursery’s and home projects occur…finishes before the new addition
comes home is what we prefer.
       In times like these...overnight bags are good to go, check…making sure all needs are accounted for to prevent
parents from being a wreck.
       But sometimes...plans change in the blink of an eye.
       About 3 am my slumber was disturbed by the worrisome voice of my better half. She expressed the new life
inside her had not been felt, and she needed to see the hospital staff.
       Now as a planner myself, this was a bit beyond my usual. To get up in the middle of the night to dash to the
blue “H” was not ritual. I make a living off planning instruction, orchestrating athletic events, and scheduling driving
sessions that aren’t manual. My plan was to perform my Tuesday morning routine of hopefully getting up in time
to workout, listen to a podcast, shower, and shop casual.
       In times like these...interruptions cannot be ignored.
       As my wife and I hurried into the hospital to gain care, the thoughts became clear that this would not be
quickly accomplished filled the air. As the nurses and doctors looked for a heartbeat, the eyes of my bride became
glossy above her mask-covered despair.
Page 10                                                                                             In Memory of Coy
       What is a husband to say in times of this snare?
       How is a queen to be addressed when there is a major problem with her heir?
       As suspicions turned to probability and then turning to fact, the information showed that gift of a child was
already home and didn’t seem possibly fair.
       In times like this...the plan wasn’t followed, at least by the perspective of this ol’ teaching fellow.
       As the facts and fear sank in, real truth began to flood the mind that God had another idea, one that was higher
than mine.
       As I consoled my darling, we both knew it to be true that no matter the storm Jesus is sitting with us. We
know good can come from this, but there was another issue that was not fun...the baby had developed so far along
that the delivery must be done.
       In times like this...silence and holding seemed to be the best answer because anything else would be too
weepy to digest.
       Because of certain facilities and needs, we were switched to another care provider whose help is in its Mission
creed.
       As my bride got her own escort steed, I moved down the road trying to see through the waterworks that were
on the inside of the car with great speed.
       In times like these...it is easy to notice the trials against you instead of the forces for good.
       As we lay there tearing and sniffling, our blessings were counted and in many ways surprise. How could so
much good come from such demise?
       In times like these...you don’t always hear:
       …about the nurses on the front lines handing out illegal hugs to hurting peers
       ... or the ER nurses who gave us an escort upstairs without signing a document before entering the delivery
room even during leap year
       …you don’t hear about the texts, emails, and messages from across the Carolinas, Alabama, Georgia, the
Midwest, and West for encouragement and prayers to be received in high gear
       …or the cafe grill master who didn’t serve cold chicken but two fresh sandwiches off the grill to provide a
small smile and lend an ear
       …or the praying on our car that helped friends draw near.
       As the minutes turned into hours and the pain medicine was given, countless times of prayer and crying were
on the scene, even past eleven.
       Google searches of “can you run out of tears?” And “memorial benches” began to appear.
       After some time passing the climax of the dread came to occur. For the delivery of a life had to happen and
the time to push was expressed by the captain in a blur.
       My wife is so strong and so majestically made because her fragrance is of Proverbs 31 and her fight is all
day.
       After all day of being poked and hurt, she gave up the child that her womb concealed. She was such a fighter
and her bravery revealed.
       As the joy of her safety combated the sadness of life lost, the reality of the dreams that were part of the cost.
       This child is a son. I had scheduled dribbling with the left-hand practice starting early the next week and to
somehow teach him not to be as fearful of snakes as me must be done.
       He was to learn to be a knight to a fair madden and keep me accountable to make my queen feel special and
unhidden.
       He was to be my superhero buddy but stand firm for the King. He was the one to make me proud but truly to
be the one that could lead his family one day and maybe even sing.
       In times like these...my plans were set. But from the words of Jeremiah, instead of Jeremy, my God knows
the plans—His plans to help others with absolutely no regret.
       We briefly got to know our son, we wanted to know the details as best we could and think about how he
would have been fun.
       He is 7 pounds, 6 ounces, has my wife’s nose, and his dad’s hair, all the while being 22 inches long. As my
wife and I passed him back and forth, the tears came swelling and burst while we were trying to be strong.
       The cheeks ran rivers that wouldn’t stop. In reflection, I noticed when I was rocking our child you could
hear a pin drop.
       The child didn’t need it because he was with his true Dad. Perhaps however the “rockee” was me, and Jesus
was really soothing this lad.

       The shortest verse in the Bible shows the caring of Christ, so maybe this was Him caring for me by allowing
me to hold this cute child enticed.
       His name is Coy Cauley and it’s not “goodbye,” but rather “I’ll see you in a minute” in the twinkling of an
eye.
       As my wife was resting and gathering strength, the Lord put on my ear a song of wavelength.
       A song from ol’ Matt that I’m sure covered some chart. I added to my Spotify two sounds above Wilson’s
lyric “Watch You be a Mother” and the song is called “Save a Place for Me” to show my heart:

      From SongLyrics:

                                              Save a Place for Me

                                               Don’t be mad if I cry
                                          It just hurts so bad sometimes
                                         ‘Cause everyday it’s sinking in
                                    And I have to say goodbye all over again

                                           You know I bet it feels good
                                         To have the weight of this world
                                             Off Your shoulders now
                                             I’m dreaming of the day
                                         When I’m finally there with You

                                    Save a place for me, save a place for me
                                      I’ll be there soon, I’ll be there soon
                                  Save a place for me, save some grace for me
                                      I’ll be there soon, I’ll be there soon

                                         I have asked the questions why
                                    But I guess the answer’s for another time
                                       So instead I’ll pray with every tear
                                   And be thankful for the time I had You here

                               So You just save a place for me, save a place for me
                                       I’ll be there soon, I’ll be there soon
                                  Save a place for me, save some grace for me
                                          I’ll be there soon, I’ll be there

                                     I wanna live my life just like You did
                                 And make the most of my time just like You did
                                   And I wanna make my home up in the sky
                                   Just like You did, oh, but until I get there
                                                Until I get there

                                  Just save a place for me, save a place for me
                                           ‘Cause I will be there soon

                                     Save a place for me, save a place for me
                                       I’ll be there soon, I’ll be there soon

                                              Don’t be mad if I cry
                                               It just hurts so bad

      As I was thinking about our son, I got the idea that after seeing my Jesus the next thing that I’m going to do
Page 12                                                                                             In Memory of Coy
is pull up a chair. Next to grandpa and grandpa and nana too, and we’ll all eat Pecan pie with Coy without a care.
        He has to have a sugar tooth—we all know his mother. She will embrace him so tight and once that is done
get another.
        In times like these...this is what I look forward. Being with Jesus and loved ones too henceforward.
        In times like these...I remember Jesus is in my boat. Though the storm rage on, He will keep us afloat.
        The world, the flesh and Satan may surround, but my King has won on the ultimate battleground.
        The trials are for our beauty to be more Christlike and blessed, so that we can hear, “Well Done,” and
have our boat sail on through to eternal rest.
                                                      The Picture
        The above poetic email and included song were what Jeremy sent to us that morning. Much like Phil and
Dianne, the song said that the answer to the why question would have to wait until another time. To some extent,
that is true. But I wanted to think through the part of that statement that is not true from another vantage point. And
writing this book will give you a chance to think through it with me. Before considering that, however, note that
the following picture of Lindsi holding the dead body of their son and our grandson was also attached to Jeremy’s
email.

      When I opened that email and saw this picture of our precious grandson’s dead body, the first thought that
came roaring into my mind, born out of raw emotion, was a mental shout: “I hate you, Jesus!”
Dealing with Stillbirth                                                                                       Page 13
      A large part of spiritual warfare is mental warfare. I did not embrace this thought. Instead, despite the
tremendous pain, I immediately fought the negative thought by countering with the silent, yet firm, mental
affirmation: “I love you, Jesus.”

                                                Good Grief
       I was not going to allow my emotions to dictate what I believe. Born out of years of practice, much like a
martial-arts expert might instinctively respond to a physical attack with a counterjab, I immediately fought back
against the mental thought of hatred with the positive affirmation of love. The Bible describes such warfare in these
terms: “Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (Jam 4:7). The bitter thought fled. To
use a well-known analogy, you cannot stop the evil thoughts from coming into your mind, but you can prevent them
from nesting in your hair. I was not going to give the devil a foothold to make me bitter and angry against the Lord.
Instead, I chose to love the Lord volitionally, and doing so enabled me to continue to love the Lord affectionately.
The emotional pain was still just as intense, to be sure, but the grief was pure, not mixed with anger or bitterness.
If pure grief can be called good grief, then this was good grief, and Dianne and I expressed lots of it that Wednesday
morning.

                                            Prefer to Weep
       We were hoping that Jeremy and Lindsi would be able to come home later that day, and Dianne needed to
finish up a couple of things at work before she could take extended bereavement time off, so she decided to go into
work. She suggested that I go into work as well, thinking that it would be better to work than to continue weeping.
I told her that I could work, if I wanted, and stop the weeping, if I preferred, by doing just that—focusing my mind
on my work. However, I told her that I would prefer to just stay home and embrace the grief and weep. Perhaps if
I were struggling with hatred, bitterness, or anger, then distracting my mind with something else might have been
the better option. But since I had already fought that battle and won it decisively and quickly, I preferred to embrace
the weeping and spent most of that morning sobbing my heart out before the Lord. Later that evening, I would have
to deal with the return of some more negative thoughts, such as, “You let me down, God.” Spiritual warfare is
generally not a one-and-done battle. It is a war, not just a single battle. Yet, rather than indulge such thoughts of
self-pity, I resisted them and, through the Lord’s grace, found victory over them. I provided the following
explanation from DLAF to describe that battle.
                                       Illustration 5. ETTL Versus Self-Pity
Page 14                                                                                             In Memory of Coy
        The following adapted extract from DLAF is fully applicable to the present situation:

               A time comes when you simply must grab your self-pity by the throat and deny its right to exist.
        Doing so is a matter of life and death. I know from firsthand experience. I have had to fight it myself.
        But I also know how to fight and win. You win it by fighting, not by whining. Through exchanged life
        (EL) teaching and tough love (TL) discipline, “I have set My face like flint, and I know that I shall not
        be ashamed” (Is 50:7; cp. Lk 9:51). The exchanged-life-tough-love (ELTL) approach I advocate is the
        same approach I took on myself.
               I found that I could not allow myself to wallow in self-pity. I had to fight it and overcome it. I
        had no pity on my self-pity. I showed no mercy, gave no quarter, to my self-pity. My self-pity was my
        mortal enemy. We engaged in hand-to-hand combat. I won. But the warfare was intense. It was not a
        single battle; it was a war. My struggle with self-pity made me increasingly stronger and my self-pity
        increasingly weaker. Eventually, I choked it to death.
               Like Jesus, I had to set my face like flint, but eventually I did not even flinch when self-pity
        came sticking its ugly head in the door. I mercilessly choked it to death every time it came knocking.
        Eventually, it got tired of the routine and stopped coming around. I think it is scared to show up
        anymore. Demons who used to torment me with it now run the other way (Jam 4:7). They don’t haunt
        or hunt me anymore. Instead, I hunt them. The hunted has become the hunter. My books are my
        weapons against them. This book will be a weapon to fight demons of self-pity.

       This extract is part of what I wrote last year in DLAF pertaining to self-pity. I live what I teach. I knew that
bouts with self-pity after Coy’s death were inevitable. This present book will continue my fight against such
demons. Embracing biblical truth is key to fighting back. We must determine to allow biblical truth to determine
what emotions we will embrace. Embracing grief in a time of grief is appropriate. Yet such grief must be kept within
proper bounds. We cannot afford to let such grief become occasions of anger against the Lord, bitterness against
the Lord, or indulging ourselves in self-pity. The biblical truth on which I want to focus in the present book finds
its source in Jeremy’s conclusion to his email. He concluded by saying, “The trials are for our beauty to be more
Christlike and blessed, so that we can hear, ‘Well Done,’ and have our boat sail on through to eternal rest.”
       Suffice it to say that hearing, “Well Done,” is a well-known reward if we are good and faithful servants
(Mt 25:21,23; Lk 19:17). Having an eternal rest in terms of heavenly rewards is also a blessed possibility if we are
faithful (Heb 3:11-4:11; Rev 14:12-13). Faithful persevering through our trials is not our means of reaching Heaven
but our means of being well rewarded in Heaven. This fundamental differentiation is well-known in our family.
God allows trials into our lives to increase our heavenly reward. This is a zoomed-out vantage point to the why
question. Most believers should be acquainted with this elementary answer. However, Jeremy’s other statement is
a more advanced answer. He said, “The trials are for our beauty.” Do you know what that means? Jeremy knew
that Dianne and I would know what he was talking about. This beauty-answer to the why question was the thesis of
my latest book, Degrees of Love and Forgiveness (DLAF), which I wrote last year. Jeremy had read that book, and
in that brief statement he had summed up that thesis as being a source of strength as he faced his trial.

                                          Mature Suffering
       Before wading into that discussion about beauty, though, some material that I had just reread while working
on another book before the stillbirth occurred would serve as a good introduction to this present topic. McLaughlin
points out that “we were designed to live on Bible doctrine.”4 We need to mature in biblical doctrine in preparation
for the trials that the Lord will allow to come our way:
               When a believer reaches a certain level of maturity, he or she is allowed upon the witness stand
        in the Angelic Conflict. It is there that Satan and his demons are allowed to push, prod, and test a
        mature believer. They do so to get a result in their favor, much like a badgering, aggressive lawyer
        who tries to squeeze a statement from a witness. But with God in the divine seat of judgment we are
        tested to our limits but not beyond, and it is surprising the limits a mature believer can endure. Satan
        is allowed much grace in this conflict and will use everything in his dirty book of tricks!5

McLaughlin continues:

      At the Judgment Seat of Christ your mastery of His word and your spiritual maneuvers during this
      conflict all come to light. That is when the Lord and all the beings, angelic and human, will see what
      you did with your time here on planet Earth. There are levels of spiritual growth and testing: evidence
      testing, testing for blessing, testing for growth, spiritual childhood, spiritual autonomy, and finally
      levels of maturity that will equal a high rank in eternity future. You cannot bring glory to God by
      maintaining a status of spiritual childhood for 20 or 30 years. That would be a statement of selfishness
      and arrogance, spending that kind of time in the spiritual life without having taken at least a few baby
      steps forward in the plan.
             Your mastery of doctrines like the Angelic Conflict and the mystery doctrine of the Church Age
      makes you a competent warrior, ready and able to stand in the gap against the demon army. A good
      question to ask yourself is, could you take a major hit or loss in your personal life and still remain
      faithful to our Lord. Job is always brought to mind in consideration of Biblical questions like this and
      he is the prime example of real evidence testing in the conflict. His tale was one of brutal and gut-
      wrenching tests that God probably used as the extreme example and not the norm in spiritual warfare.
      Job lost wealth and health, family and friendships, his reputation was in jeopardy and he was struggling
      and stumbling to get through it the whole time. He was given over to Satan himself, and that is the
      most severe test and also the highest honor in this heavenly court case.
             The tests could have lasted months, or a few years, but in the end he was given double portions
      and better blessing than what he had at the start of the test. Is the faith and endurance needed for such
      testing in your soul right now? If not, God cannot use you on the front lines just yet. Will your
      testimony aid in putting the fallen angels in a permanent and fiery prison cell for eternity, or are you
      one of the spiritual babes that wants to hide behind the safety of the mature warriors on the front lines?6

      The angels are blown away when a weaker creature, under difficult circumstances, withstands attacks
      and confusion, relies on God and applies His Word to keep pressing forward. This is a powerful and
      deadly artillery shell on the battlefield of angelic, invisible warfare. This is the statement on the witness
      stand that proclaims God is righteous, just and fair, a loving and compassionate authority figure that
      you can trust.7

      The born again believer who reaches maturity has much to gain. There are crowns and authority given
      to them beyond the average believer who simply made that one-shot decision believing that Christ is
      the Savior.8

      So God supplies the solution before the problem, which is a common doctrinal principle that every
      Christian should know.
             Suffering could be viewed as a spotlight on talent! The angels are watching believers under
      pressure and the outcome does matter. Your mental attitude and your words and actions under pressure
      are pertinent. Suffering for blessing focuses on God’s grace and God's power. It is the invisible hero
      who shifts the focus off self and glorifies and worships God instead. It is not boast to glorify self but
      boasting of (rejoicing in) the dynamic mental attitude of spiritual growth facing preventative
      suffering.9

      The final and highest type of suffering for blessing is evidence testing. Evidence testing is given for
      the mature believer to glorify God to the maximum in the Angelic Conflict.
            This type of testing was what Job and the apostle Paul experienced, as well as, and primarily,
      our Lord Jesus Christ. In fact the Lord endured more attacks and pressure—as well as physical and

      mental pain—than any other being in the universe. This type of testing does not happen until a maturity
      level is reached and God can recognize that you are ready for it. There is no definite set of rules or
      regulations pertaining to spiritual tests, but the most common areas are your wealth, health, and
      personal relationships. These are the ones that are day-to-day challenges and tests that come from God
      and the devil’s world.10

        Such comments from McLaughlin are useful in demonstrating that mature believers can experience severe
trials because one purpose of their maturity is to prepare them for such trials so that they can be witnesses to God’s
grace before the angels. “Without a test there is no testimony.”11 A mature testimony requires a mature testifier. A
card Jeremy received from one of his friends during this time expresses a similar vantage point regarding maturity:
             I figured it was time for me to write you a letter instead of the other way around for a change.
      When I heard the news, my heart SANK, and the first thing I thought was that you and Lindsi are two
      of the best people I know and didn’t deserve any of this. However, it crossed my mind that of everyone,
      you could handle this better than anyone.
             I know a lot of people are probably reaching out to you, but I just wanted you to understand
      how much I respect you and want to be [like] you one day. I also know you’re in pain right now, and
      we both know that it is for a bigger reason all around. You and I both will see your boy one day, and
      I can’t wait to meet him and tell him how great you are in this life.

       This friend reached out to Jeremy, confident that Jeremy and Lindsi’s maturity and strength in the Lord had
prepared them for this trial. At the same time, he also appealed to their mutual faith that God had a bigger reason
as a means of solace during this time. Dianne was groping for that bigger reason when she kept saying, “I know
that we are not supposed to ask why, but….” She wanted to know why God allowed this seemingly mindless tragedy
to take place. What could possibly be the Master’s master plan, His bigger reason, for allowing the stillbirth of a
child that otherwise would have been raised in a very mature, loving, Christian environment and, in all likelihood,
have grown up to follow in the footsteps of his parents? How could she make sense of such a seemingly senseless
act?
       McLaughlin’s statements are true, and to a point are anticipatory of the thesis I developed in DLAF which
addresses that question regarding the vantage point of the bigger reason. The following is composed of abbreviated
excerpts from part of that material in DLAF. After presenting part of that abridged discussion, I will share why,
from my vantage point that Tuesday morning, the seemingly senselessness of Coy’s death was the very thing that
made sense of his death. But first let me lay the groundwork for that answer by reviewing the material from DLAF
that formed a basis for Jeremy’s statement that “the trials are for our beauty to be more Christlike and blessed,
so that we can hear, “Well Done,” and have our boat sail on through to eternal rest.” Jeremy rightly associates
the beauty of being more Christlike with being blessed in a manner that transcends this present life and finds
fulfillment in the next. The trials are intended to make us more beautiful in such a way that will allow us to be
blessed in our eternal rest. Obviously, Jeremy is thinking about a blessed reward, just like Jesus:
      3
        “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 4 “Blessed are those who mourn,
      for they shall be comforted. 5 “Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth. 6 “Blessed are
      those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. 7 “Blessed are the merciful,
      for they shall receive mercy. 8 “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. 9 “Blessed are
      the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. 10 “Blessed are those who have been persecuted
      for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 “Blessed are you when men cast
      insults at you, and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, on account of Me.
      12
         “Rejoice, and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great, for so they persecuted the prophets
      who were before you. (Mt 5:3-12)

Jesus expects us to rejoice in our sufferings. Why? Because they result in a great reward in Heaven. What
Jeremy understood was that a large part of that reward is grounded in increased beauty. Adopting this
perspective allows us to see beauty in the tragedy. Through the eyes of faith, we can see the beauty being
produced both temporally and eschatologically, both within them, for them, and for the Lord.

                              Suffering for Beauty’s Sake
      The following discussion of beauty is a shortened adaptation from DLAF. Not all of God’s children will
know equal amounts of God’s love through all eternity. The epidemy of God’s love is reserved for a portion of
humanity, namely, believers who joyfully endure their trials because of their faith in the Lord’s master plan. They
do not enjoy the trials, but their faith in the bigger picture allows them to rejoice in the midst of their pain.
                                     Illustration 6. The Pearl of Great Price




       In commanding us to lay up treasure for ourselves in Heaven (Mt 6:20), God has commanded us to follow
His example. The Lord is not commanding us to be selfish—but to act in His best interest which is our own best
interest. He wants us to lay up treasure so that we might become His treasure (Mt 13:44)—His Bride. The ultimate
purpose for which God created this universe was not to create a kingdom, but to create a Queen. Creating a
kingdom was a means to an end. God could create a universe and a kingdom without sin. But He could not
create a Queen without allowing sin. Sin was the necessary price, which cost His blood, His pain, His
suffering, to produce a Queen worthy of Himself. God allows sin and suffering so that He might create the
Bride of Christ and so that we might qualify to be the Bride of Christ. Doing so was the only way to produce
the Bride of Christ. Why does God allow good people to suffer? So that they might become beautiful members
of the Bride of Christ. Suffering could not be limited to them but was for them. Allowing an opponent to
come about who would cause a war in which collateral suffering would occur was necessary to accomplish
the bridal objective.
       When Jesus died for humanity, it was primarily for His Bride. In the upper room, He told His disciples:
“Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. You are My friends, if you do what I
command you” (Jn 15:13-14). Jesus’ greatest affectual love was in laying down His life for His friends, not for His
enemies. He loved His friends to the “full extent of His love” (Jn 13:1; NIV)—in full measure, fully, completely
(FB), to the uttermost (GD). Yes, Jesus died for His enemies. He laid down His life even for His enemies. At the
very least, He had volitional love for His enemies, even for those who crucified Him and for those who would never
believe in Him. In like token, He also died for believers who would be at enmity with Him and who would fail to
Page 18                                                                                             In Memory of Coy
qualify to be His Bride. Nevertheless, His greatest love was for those believers who would obey Him and thus
qualify to be His friends—His bridal companions. These bridal saints are the Queen whose beauty King Jesus will
seek (Ps 45:11). He values Her beauty. Just as the merchant valued the pearl of great price because of its valuable
beauty, so Christ will value the Bride because of Her compelling beauty. The compelling motivation moving Jesus
to die for the world in Jn 3:16 was not to save the whole world, even though His death made the whole world
savable. Rather, His primary reason for dying for the whole world was in order to lay down His life for His friends—
for those believers who would ultimately compose the Bride. As the Gospel of John progresses from Jn 3:16 to
Jn 15:13, we learn that Jesus’ love for the world was collateral to His love for His friends. Collateral suffering by
the world and by His friends was unavoidable if He was to produce a Bride.
                              Illustration 7. The Pearl of Great Price is not the Body




       Moral evil was allowed for the greater good. The only way for the Father to form a Bride for Christ
was to allow the presence of moral evil. Believers form the body of Christ, but the Bride of Christ is formed
from the body of Christ. Just as Adam’s bride, Eve, was formed from his body and distinct from his body,
so the Bride of Christ is formed from the body of Christ and distinct from His body. Even though the oyster
uses the same substance to form its shell as it does the pearl, no one would mistake the pearl for the shell.
Even so, no one should confuse the Bride of Christ with the body of Christ. Only by overcoming evil do
believers become suitable to be a Bride for Christ. Just as the pearl is formed from the body of the oyster but
removed from the oyster, the Bride of Christ is formed from the body of Christ but removed from the body
of Christ. Just as it takes heat and pressure to turn coal into a diamond and takes an irritant to cause an
oyster to produce a pearl, moral evil was necessary for believers to be made into a mature Bride. Oysters
produce pearls as a defense mechanism because something is hurting them. Likewise, only by overcoming
painful evil can faithful believers become experiential and misthological partakers in the divine nature
(2Pet 1:4-8).12 The Bride is God’s pearl of great price. And that price required permitting moral evil.
       Just as collateral suffering was necessary to produce the Bride, so was collateral love. Jesus could die for the
whole world, that is, for every human being in the world, but He could not die for them with the same degree of

  Misthology is a coined term derived from the Greek word misthos (reward) and logos (teaching) and refers to the
doctrine of temporal and eternal rewards but is used primarily in reference to eternal rewards. Misthological is the
adjectival form (derived from misthos) used in reference to rewards, which are costly, acquisitioned by linear
faithfulness. Soteriology is based on two biblical Greek words, soteria (salvation) and logos (teaching), and
correspondingly refers to biblical teaching about salvation. Although the biblical concept of salvation includes many
dimensions other than deliverance from Hell, it is this aspect of salvation to which writers refer frequently when
they use the word soteriology. Thus, salvation from Hell (or more specifically, from eternal damnation in the Lake
of Fire) will be referred to as soteriological salvation. Soteriological is the adjectival form (derived from soteria)
used in reference to salvation from Hell. Soteriological life is freely received upon the condition of punctiliar faith
in Christ alone for eternal life as a free gift.

affection. Necessarily, even at the point of offering up His life for the whole world, He loved those who would
comprise His Bride more than He loved those who would not. Love is proportional to value. Firefighters risk their
lives indiscreetly to save those in need. Understandably, though, if the call that came into the station was for the
home of one of the firefighter’s and he realized that his own wife was in danger and they rushed to his house and
he rushed in to save his wife, he would have a greater affectional love on this occasion in risking his life than he
would when risking his life to save another man’s wife. We would not fault him for having greater affectual love
in risking his life to save his own wife than when he was risking his life to save another man’s wife. Affectionately,
he values his wife more than another man’s wife. Nothing is immoral in the differentiation in value. Neither should
we fault the Lord for having greater affectual love for those who would compose His Bride than those who would
not, especially since He equally laid down His life for both. The degree of affectual love and motivation was
different, but the volitional love expressed in the sacrificial love was equivalent. Jesus’ love for each individual
person in the world was not equal nor was it infinite for each person, but it was sufficient to make them savable. He
genuinely offers eternal life to everyone who hears the gospel message. Nevertheless, Christ’s greater love for future
bridal believers at the point He died for them was based on the affectionate love that He foresaw eventually
occurring with them.
       Jesus died for all humanity, knowing that a portion of humanity would believe in Him and that a subset of
those believers would qualify to be His Bride. Basically, He died for His Bride. Other portions of humanity were
not excluded from the scope of His death and love, of course, but neither were they the focus of His death and love
or the driving motive for His death. In the final analysis, from the scope of the wide-angle lens that sees infinity,
Christ’s love for the Bride was so great that, comparatively speaking, His death was for the bridal portion of the
church rather than for the rest of humanity, just as Paul indicates:
      25
        Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her; 26 that
      He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, 27 that He might
      present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she
      should be holy and blameless. (Eph 5:25-27)

       Jesus died to get a Bride. The Lord greatly desires our beauty because it is His beauty being manifested within
us by the Holy Spirit. God loves Himself. The Bride gets to participate in this trinitarian love. The Bride will love
herself as well when she sees how beautiful her victory has made Her, how much like Him it has made Her. The
Bride will be one spirit with the Lord just as a husband and wife are one flesh. The ugliness we must go through
now is our beauty treatment. We had to become ugly ducklings if we were to become the most beautiful of swans.
God will use our suffering to make us beautiful—if we let Him. But we are not passive couch potatoes in the process.
He makes us beautiful by teaching us how to fight. If you want to be like God, fight.
       The reason God allowed sin was to maximize our love for Him (cp. Lk 7:47). This maximization occurs in
the creation of the Bride. The reason God allowed sin was so that He could create a Bride that would more fully
share His nature, experientially. All believers share God’s nature ontologically, but bridal believers will share His
nature/character more fully, experientially. To maximize our knowledge of Him, and thus maximize our
participation in eternal life (Jn 17:3), God had to permit sin.
       By fighting, we develop a character more like God’s; we become more godlike, more Christlike, more
beautiful. Something Beautiful, by Bill Gaither, catches something of this spirit:

                                        Something beautiful, something good
                                          All my confusion He understood
                                  All I had to offer Him was brokenness and strife
                                    But he made something beautiful of my life

But this beauty is not automatic; it is not true of every believer. You must wrap up your sorrows and disappointments
and lay them at the Cross, as the song goes on to express. Or, as expressed in terms of the exchanged life, you must
appropriate the reality of your death with Christ.
      Scars, by I Am They, is a very touching song. Our Lord’s scars are very endearing; they endear the Lord to
us. Yet we should not want to trade the scars of our deepest pain, for our wounds are a story Christ will use to
endear us to Him because they allow us to know His heart:

        For scars to be beautiful, they must end in triumph—in victory—otherwise, they are just a tragedy. We must
allow the Holy Spirit to minister to our hurts and lead us into victory, to experience the power of Christ’s resurrected
life, so that our scars can be transformed into something beautiful in our spirit. We must be able to express the
above song in a genuine spirit of thankfulness rather than self-pity. We must be thankful for our scars. They allow
us to become His Bride. The Lord is thankful for His scars. They allow Him to have a Bride. Jesus did not have an
attitude of self-pity. We must not give in to self-pity either. Use the above song to overcome self-pity with
thankfulness.
        Now, as to the Bride, God’s love for Her is infinite because Her potential value is infinite, not only
horizontally but vertically. Why did God allow sin and suffering? What was the greater good that could possibly
Dealing with Stillbirth                                                                                            Page 21
justify so much evil? Carmical answers: “An infinite, eternal good justifies the use of finite, temporal evils.”13 God
allowed evil for the greater good: “The end that justified the means of creating a world in which a finite amount of
sin would occur for a finite amount of time” (MSIH). Ok, but what is this infinite good that could justify so much
evil? As discussed in MMP3: “Some of the videos on YouTube about the Bride picture Christ as saying that the
Bride’s beauty proves that she was worth His life. (Of course, this beauty is not merely the beauty of her appearance
but the beauty of her character since the latter will result in the former.)” The Bride was worth Christ’s life!
        Surely, we must conclude that Christ can create a Bride worthy of Himself. He can, and He will. He will
succeed. He will not fail. He wants Her to feel beautiful because She is beautiful. She is flawless in beauty, worth
every bit of His desire for her beauty, worth every ounce of His affection for Her (Ps 45:11). Her infinite value
more than offsets the finite sin that was necessary to create the beauty of Her character. Was Eve a
fit/suitable/comparable companion for Adam (Gen 2:20)? Yes! Eve typologically represents the Bride of Christ.
The Lord’s Bride, likewise, will be a fit/suitable/comparable companion for Himself. Eve was worthy of Adam’s
affection because God created her to be worthy of his affection. The Bride, likewise, will be worthy of Christ’s
affection. His love infuses Her with His nature. His loving discipline infuses Her with His character. She will
ontologically participate in His nature and experientially participate in His character. Their shared experiences in
fighting and suffering now and their shared experiences in the future will make Her infinitely beautiful and valuable.
She will become even more beautiful throughout eternity future, as Her intrinsic, ontological, misthological beauty
becomes increasingly realized functionally. What a return on His investment!
        If you want to contemplate just how beautiful the Bride is, you must not only look at the Cross but at Hell.
She must not only be beautiful enough to justify Jesus’ death but all the sorrows and sufferings of Hell and the
present life! God could have chosen to create freewill creatures that would never sin and yet rule. Moreover, they
could learn and grow from their ruling experience through all eternity. But such sinless creatures could never ever
attain to the beauty of the Bride. Why? For the Bride to become as beautiful as She will be, She had to suffer sin
and fight sin. In doing so, She becomes more like Her Groom. He had to suffer sin and fight sin in order for the
full beauty of His character to be made manifest. Jesus is both suffering servant and conquering hero. He is looking
for a Bride who shares this same character. The Lord had to allow sin and suffering so that we might better
understand His nature and experientially share in it. Although holy angels have fought sin, they have not fought it
as the Bride has, nor have they suffered as She has. Nor do they partake of God’s nature as fully as She does.
Therefore, they are not as beautiful as She is. She not only had to fight sin without; She has had to suffer and fight
sin within.
        Presently, not only does the Bride have to live in a hostile, visible, sinful, worldly environment, but She must
defeat invisible spiritual forces while doing so. Moreover, not all these spiritual forces are external. Sin, as a spiritual
entity, still resides in Her flesh. Talk about a pressure cooker! God is using all this sin to turn us into an exquisite
diamond that has been formed under heat and pressure. As Hawk Nelson affirms in his song, Diamonds:

                                            He’s making diamonds, diamonds
                                               Making diamonds out of dust
                                              He is refining and in His timing
                                              He's making diamonds out of us
                                  I'll surrender to the power of being crushed by love
                                     Till the beauty that was hidden isn’t covered up
                                                Oh it’s not what I hoped for
                                               It’s something much better…
                                                  When the pressure is on
                                                   He’s making diamonds

       You can’t make a diamond without pressure, and you can’t make a pearl without pain. God is making us into
a priceless pearl formed from the internal pain we have endured. We must cherish these opportunities to suffer and
fight. We only have a very brief window of opportunity to develop a beautiful godly character through suffering
and fighting. If we are victorious, we will have tremendous internal glory: “For I consider that the sufferings of this
present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in (eis) us” (Rom 8:18; cp.
vv. 8:17b,21). This glory to be revealed in us is the revealing of the glory of the beauty of faithful believers (GNTC).

                                   He Loves Her Because She is Beautiful
      Steve Green’s The Beauty of the Bride affirms the Lord will be captivated by the hidden beauty of the Bride:

                                         I’m a part of the beauty of the bride
                                                   My belongingness
                                             Was bought by His faithfulness
                                             Was purchased with His blood
                                                We will see Him coming
                                             With His arms held open wide
                                      Captivated by the hidden beauty of the bride

Green’s emphasis on inner beauty is biblical (cp. 1Pet 3:4). All the sin within us will be removed. Yippie! Only a
godly character will remain. I can hardly wait! Still, Christ will be captivated by more than just our inner beauty.
Other songwriters do better in capturing the gist of the principal passage (SSol 4:9): “You have captivated my heart,
my sister, my bride; you have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace”
(ESV). “You have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; you have ravished my heart with one look of your eyes,
with one link of your necklace” (NKJ). The Bride captures the Lord’s heart with her ravishing beauty. King Jesus
will greatly desire Her beauty (Ps 45:11). This beauty is not hidden; it can be seen! It is not merely internal; it is
external as well. She will be beautiful through and through and dressed in beauty: “Let us rejoice and be glad and
give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready. And it was
given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints”
(Rev 19:7-8). Her skin will be without spot or wrinkle or any such thing; rather, She will be holy and blameless
(Eph 5:27). Based on such passages, we can confidently say to the Lord,

                                                 I am beautiful to You,
                                          For You see me not only for who I am,
                                               But also for who I will be.

                                                You love me for my beauty,
                                   Not only for the inner beauty You see hidden in me,
                                  But also for the ravishing beauty I will be for all to see.

                                  Yet You love me not only for my beauty which all see;
                                      You love me because You know the real me.
                                                  You really love me.

      If we amend the words of How He Loves by the David Crowder Band to make that song more directly
applicable to the Bride, we might entitle it How He Loves Her:

                             He is jealous for Her, loves like a hurricane, She is a tree,
                                 Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy.
                         When all of a sudden, She is aware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
                                       And She realizes just how beautiful She is,
                                       And how great His affections are for Her.

                                                       He loves Her,
                                                   Oh how He loves Her,
                                                   Oh how He loves Her,
                                                    Oh how He loves.

In You Have Ravished My Heart by Brian and Jenn Johnson, the Bride ravishes the heart of Christ with Her beauty:

                                                I will draw you to me forever
                                          In righteousness in justice and in mercy
Dealing with Stillbirth                                                                                          Page 23
                                              I will draw you and me together
                                       In loving kindness in faithfulness and in grace
                                      No longer your master but your husband I will be

                                                You have ravished my heart
                                                With one glance of your eyes
                                                   How fair is your love
                                                  My promised my bride14

Likewise, Song of the Beautiful Bride by Paul Wilbur portrays the beauty of the Bride:

                                         Bathed in His glory, reflecting His light
                                               Oh, what a beautiful bride
                                                    From every nation
                                                     From every tribe
                                        Clothed with His righteousness, fully alive
                                           Hear the song of the beautiful bride
                                                   Oh, what a mystery
                                                   How great the love

       The beauty of the Bride’s hidden internal beauty will shine through Her externally so that She will shine like
Her Husband “brighter than the sun” (Acts 26:13), like “the stars for ever and ever” (Dan 12:3). The more She
suffers, the more beautiful She becomes: “Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes
upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you; but to the degree that you share
the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing; so that also at the revelation of His glory, you may rejoice with
exultation” (1Pet 4:12-13). A direct correlation is expected between Her degree of suffering and Her degree of
exultation. We must “exult in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance; and
perseverance, proven character, and proven character, hope” (Rom 5:3-4). Overcoming the trials gives us proven
character (i.e., internal beauty) and hope (i.e., confident expectation) of misthological beauty. This beauty is more
than sentimental value. It is not fluff; it is real stuff: “For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal
weight of glory far beyond all comparison” (2Cor 4:17).
       This beauty is tangible, measurable, so real you can weigh it. Instead of being crushed by its weight, you will
be blown away by its power. The force of this beauty blows like the overpowering solar winds of a solar hurricane.
This solar-force beauty can be measured: “There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another
glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory” (1Cor 15:41). Bridal believers will shine like stars in the glory
of their beauty, but not all stars shine with equal luminosity. You can measure a star’s luminosity by measuring the
amount of total energy output (light/power) it emits in watts. The glory of the Bride will be just as real as the glory
of the Groom. The glory of the Goddess will be just as real as the glory of God, which makes sense since the Lord
shares His glory with the Bride in the form of co-glory (Rom 8:17b).
       This affirmation of measurable objective value is not meant to devalue subjective sentimental value, though.
The Bride obviously has value because of Her Lord’s affectionate love for Her. His affectionate love for Her also
gives Her infinite value. He values not just Her radiant, objective beauty but also the subjective beauty of Her
heart—a heart affectionately in love with Him. Emotions have value. We can easily relate to the multifaceted nature
of such love. As a husband, I love my wife’s love. I love not only her physical beauty but also her laugh, positive
outlook, diligent work ethic, faith, loving nature, etc., but perhaps most of all, what I love most is her love for me.
I love the way she makes me feel—loved. Similarly, the Lord will love everything about His Bride, including how
She feels about Him and the way She makes Him feel. His love for Her makes Her valuable. Her love for Him
makes Her valuable. Her character makes Her valuable. Her ontological and experiential participation in His divine
nature make Her valuable. Her capabilities make Her valuable. Her tender loving nature makes Her valuable
(2Pet 1:4). Her moral strength makes Her valuable. Her wisdom makes her valuable. The bottom line is that She is
loved because She is valuable, and, conversely, She is valuable because She is loved. An ever-deepening, perpetual,

        We know that some believers will be more glorious/luminous than others on the outside. We also know that
those believers who are more glorious/luminous on the outside have a godlier character on the inside. Not all
members of the Bride are equally luminous. Therefore, we can infer that they are not equally godly on the inside.
Since Scripture uses the analogy of the stars to illustrate the phenomenon, we can formulate a hypothesis using stars
to explain the difference.
        My theory is that the trichotomous spirits of believers develop to various stages of godliness. The spirit of a
believer cast into the outer darkness (which pictures loss of reward) does not achieve sufficient godliness to burst
forth misthologically in spiritual nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is the type of energy used to fuel stars. Angels are
spirit beings. Yet not all these spirit beings are equally glorious. Just as God created stars with various degrees of
internal nuclear fusion, He created angelic spirits with various degrees of glory. It stands to reason that the luminous
capacity of angels varies according to the luminous capacity of their individual spiritual composition. Just as the
inner composition of one star varies from another star so that this inner variation explains their different degrees of
luminous glory, so the inner composition of one believer can vary significantly from the inner composition of
another believer. I would further pose that the inner composition for each believer is unique, yet not so unique as to
prevent classification and stratification. For example, some angels are archangels. Presumably, archangels are more
glorious than lower ranked angels and correspondingly have a more glorious composition. Yet we need not pose
that each archangel has the same internal composition. The internal composition of one archangel could vary from
another archangel much like no two snowflakes are identical. The internal composition of each spirit being would
be the unique spiritual fingerprint of that spirit being. The same is true of the trichotomous spirit of believers.
                       Illustration 8. Misthologically Precious Gentle Trichotomous Spirit




        As a believer walks in dependency upon the Spirit and is strengthened by the Spirit, his or her spirit becomes
strong, yet gentle and humble. Understandably, therefore, Peter sums up by exhorting believers to be “humble in
spirit...for you were called for this very purpose that you might inherit a blessing” (1Pet 3:8-9). This misthological
blessing is reminiscent of Jesus’ blessing: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven”
(Mt 5:3). The poor in spirit are the humble in spirit who have become strong in spirit by the power of the Spirit.
Their regenerate trichotomous spirits have undergone a transformation beyond the original, immature, new-birth
state which their spirit originally had at regeneration. At the point of new birth, they were spiritually immature.
Their trichotomous spirits needed to grow, to mature, to develop their full potential. Undergoing fiery trials is the
means to an end—to produce a misthologically precious trichotomous spirit within.
        Paul concurs that believers can experience dynamic, ongoing, present transformation: “And do not be
conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind” (Rom 12:2). “But we all, with unveiled
face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory,
just as from the Lord, the Spirit” (2Cor 3:18). My theory is that this transformation goes all the way to the believer’s
trichotomous core. Their immature regenerate spirit is being transformed into greater Christlikeness, maturity, and
Dealing with Stillbirth                                                                                           Page 25
glory. As a result, the spirits of mature believers will shine greater in glory than those of immature believers. Both
the spirit of an immature believer and the spirit of a mature believer will be sinless. But the spirit of the carnally
immature believer will be shineless, or at least shine less. The beauty of the bridal believer is more than skin deep,
more than soul deep; it is spirit deep. At the transformation of their physical bodies into their misthologically
glorified bodies, the misthological, mature spirits of bridal believers will shine forth in radiant beauty. Carnal
believers, likewise, will have transformed bodies, but their immature spirits will not be transformed because their
spirits are not being transformed now. The spirit of a carnal believer will only have undergone the soteriological
baseline transformation that it experienced at regeneration. The time to transform your spirit is now. If you want a
radiant, beautiful spirit in eternity future, you must allow the Spirit to strengthen your humble spirit now. The
developing time for your spirit is in the here-and-now, not in the hereafter. The hereafter will primarily reveal the
degree of development you achieved in the here-and-now. If you want a bridal spirit then, you must develop a bridal
spirit now.
        The Bride is the pearl of great price. The core of Her beauty is Her trichotomous spirit. Having a sinless
trichotomous spirit is not our goal. That is a free gift. Every believer has a born-again, trichotomous spirit which
cannot sin (1Jn 3:9). God could have created humanity with such a nature at the very beginning. But He did not. He
needed to allow sin so that our regenerate sinless nature might grow strong in its opposition to sin. Although this
sinless nature cannot sin, it can receive battle scars in its fight against sin. Just as Jesus did not sin and could not
sin, yet He still bears the scars of His fight against sin, so too the Bride will wear Her internal scars against sin.
These scars create a unique signature, a unique spiritual fingerprint, so to speak, within the spirit of each bridal
believer. Yet these battle scars make the Bride all the more beautiful.
        Royce Powell correctly recognizes that “collectively, overcomers are the Bride of Christ” (p. 40). “Through
the power of the Holy Spirit,” Christ is presently “locating and beautifying a bride from among the body of the
church” (p. 52). Powell uses an OT analogy to explain how the scars of present sufferings can be used by the Lord
to make us internally beautiful:

       Every sacrifice has cedar wood. Solomon is told that no stone would be seen in the temple, all covered
       with wood. These boards are carved with the shapes of flowers and cherubim and palms trees, speaking
       of the cutting edge of God’s Word. The carving hurts. It is the pruning that hurts us. This is suffering,
       but when we are in difficulty, the carving is done by the great artisan, tracing a pattern for our life. The
       deeper the cut, the deeper the gold overlay. The more difficult our life, the more gold we shall receive
       at the Judgment Seat of Christ. “For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to
       be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us” (Romans 8:18).15

       Each bridal believer will have a unique pattern cut into his or her spirit but filled with gold. If we overcome
our sufferings by the power of the Holy Spirit and allow Him to fill our spirit with His beauty, then the deeper the
cut, the more gold He uses to fill it. Suffering is not enough, though. Everybody suffers. Overcoming the difficulties
in our lives by the power of the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential if we are to fill our suffering with beauty. Believers
who suffer the most have the greatest potential for eternal, internal beauty because of what they have suffered.
Nevertheless, they will fail to actualize that beauty if they fail to overcome their self-pity. By the power of the Spirit,
they must allow their scars to be filled with the Spirit’s golden beauty so that they can become the raving beauty
that God has designed for them to be. Yes, they have been hurt. Carving and pruning are intended to hurt. Yet God’s
intended purpose for the hurt is to make them more beautiful than they can possibly imagine. Each bridal believer
will have a trichotomous spirit of infinite value and beauty.
                                                    Infinite Beauty
       Is the beauty of the Groom finite or infinite? Infinite, obviously. Consequently, we must deduce that the
beauty of the Bride is also infinite, not only in duration but in value, thus making Her invaluable. Haller correctly
notes that “the duration and severity of hell are congruous with sin against the infinite holy God” (Matthew, GNTC,
121). The quality and quantity of punishment are congruent with the nature of the Person against whom the sin is
committed and thus eternal. Sin against the infinitely holy God deserves an infinite punishment because of the
infinite nature of the Person against whom the sin was committed. How about sin against the infinitely holy and

beautiful Goddess? Such sin is necessary, but sin is still equally hideous. She must finitely endure such finite sin
in order to become infinitely beautiful. The beauty of Her holiness would be impossible to create apart from the sin
that She endures. Her resulting holiness makes Her beautiful. Adam was merely created innocent in a neutral state.
She has been made holy, a positive attribute, by Her positive fight against sin:

                Holiness is positive, and Adam’s innocence was accompanied by a capacity for holiness.
         Holiness is the result of faithfulness under testing, in man’s case. He may go into testing innocent, but
         the very essence of testing is a capacity to choose between two courses, his own and God’s.
                Faith, obedience, loyalty to God, resisting evil by resort to God, issue in a positive state which
         is something more than innocence, i.e. more than the fact of not yet having sinned.17

        The Bride’s resulting holiness is beautiful. The fact that we are to worship God in the beauty of holiness
(Ps 96:10) certainly indicates that holiness is beautiful. Whereas the beauty of God’s holiness is intrinsic to His
eternal nature, the beauty of the Bride is intrinsic to Her new nature, which is derived from His nature. Amazingly,
though, the Bride can grow in beauty. Her beauty is not static but can grow dynamically and dramatically, especially
as She grows in holiness. Even so, Her opportunity to increase the rate at which this growth can occur is set in this
life. We all know about our IQ (intelligence quotient). Early in our life, we can increase our IQ. As we get older,
our IQ stabilizes. The Bride, likewise, has a BQ (beauty quotient). The time for Her to increase Her BQ is early in
Her life, that is, in the present life. Sin and suffering give Her the opportunity to increase Her BQ dramatically. But
sin and suffering will be removed from Her in the hereafter. Thus, She must do all that She can to increase Her BQ
right now in the here-and-now, even to the point of shedding Her own blood if necessary.
       The Bride has been cleansed soteriologically and misthologically by the blood of the Lamb. Nevertheless,
the latter cleansing frequently requires Her own blood as well. The blood of the Bride has been shed since the
beginning, when Cain killed Abel. From Genesis to Revelation, the blood of the Bride cries out for vengeance. “The
voice of your brother’s blood is crying to Me from the ground” (Gen 4:10). “They cried out with a loud voice,
saying, ‘How long, O Lord, holy and true, wilt Thou refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those who
dwell on the earth?’” (Rev 6:10). We were “redeemed with precious [timios] blood, as of a lamb unblemished and
spotless, the blood of Christ” (1Pet 1:18). Timios means valuable, precious, costly, of great worth or value.
Naturally, we affirm these attributes for Christ’s blood. Yet we should also affirm these attributes regarding the
Bride’s blood. After all, the same word is used to describe the death of those who comprise the Bride: “Precious
[timios] in the sight of the Lord is the death of His godly ones” (Ps 116:15; LXX). The godly compose the Goddess.
Despite Her present circumstances, by faith the Bride must affirm Her self-worth, Her own personal worthiness.
God’s appraisal of a godly wife is well known: “An excellent wife, who can find? For her worth is far above jewels”
(Prov 31:10). Imagine how much greater will be His appraisal of His own godly Bride!

                                                  Blind Faith
       As noted in the present book, Jeremy had read DLAF last year, from which the above abbreviated excerpts
were taken. The present discussion will build upon that material as we ask the question, “Why would God allow
mature, faithful believers like Jeremy and Lindsi to suffer a stillbirth?” At the macro level, based on the above
discussion, we can answer that the reason is because God allows such believers to suffer so that He can increase
their maturity and beauty and, in turn, increase their reward and love.
       At the micro level, however, we cannot give a response that answers the why question as to how it plays out
right now in the complexity of the present temporal situation. From this micro vantage point, Phil and Dianne were
correct, to a considerable extent, in saying that we cannot answer the why question.
       When Dianne’s dad died years ago, it was a merciful death. His health was failing, and it was time for him
to go home and be with the Lord. When my dad died a few years ago, it was a merciful timing as well. His health
also was failing. When Dianne’s mother died a few months ago, it was, likewise, a merciful timing for the same
reason. We can see why their passing on to be with the Lord made sense from our temporal vantage point. Being
able to see the reason at this micro level made it easier to accept the macro explanation that they were going on to
something better in Heaven and that we would see them again soon. Their deaths were much easier for me and

Dianne to accept because the timing of these deaths made sense at both the micro and macro levels. Indeed, their
deaths were a merciful answer to prayer. But Coy’s seemingly ill-timed death does not fit into this paradigm. We
were praying for his healthy delivery and birth, looking forward to our present time with him here on Earth.
       For such reasons, Dianne told our family and friends that dealing with Coy’s death was much harder than her
having to face cancer four years ago and having to face it yet again the previous week. Four years ago, Dianne had
stage-3 breast cancer. This was a life-threatening trial. Dealing with it was a long ordeal, involving surgeries,
chemotherapy, radiation treatments, and years of follow-up medication and testing. Annual MRIs are part of the
follow-up testing. Her MRI earlier this month showed an abnormality. We had to face the possibility that the cancer
had returned. We prayed that this was not the case, but we prepared to accept the Lord’s will whatever the outcome
would be. Dianne had lived a life full of loving and trusting the Lord, and even as she faced the prospect of death,
she was still able to trust the Lord without questioning His will—without raising the why question. We could make
some sense out of why God might allow the cancer to take her home early.18 Thankfully, God answered our prayer,
and the mammogram the following week confirmed that the cancer had not returned. We received that confirmation
on Tuesday, 4/14/2020. The next Tuesday, Coy died. The Lord gave us joy on Tuesday; the next Tuesday He took
our joy away. In agony, we say with Job: “The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the
Lord” (Job 1:21). As in the song, We Praise You in This Storm, “I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and
takes away.”
       Coy’s death seemed, and still seems, completely senseless from our present micro vantage point. We could
not see and cannot see why this outcome was the best course of action for God to take. How could this be the greater
good? To accept this greater-good rationale as true and to continue to affirm that God is good, we have to accept it
in blind faith, from the micro vantage point.
       By blind faith, I do not mean a faith that has no rational basis for trusting God. Far to the contrary, I have
excellent, logical reasons to trust God and believe that, as stressed in the God’s Not Dead movies, God is good all
the time, and all the time God is good. This affirmation of God’s goodness is especially applicable as a reward to
those among God’s people who are pure in heart: “Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart!”
(Ps 73:1). God is good to those who love Him: “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good
to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose” (Rom 8:28). Necessarily, however, part
of His goodness requires allowing them to suffer.
       As summarized in the train illustrations, my faith is in the facts. And the fact is that I have numerous reasons
to trust God—reasons from Scripture, from the testimonies of others, and from our own personal experiences of
God’s grace in the past, Dianne’s cancer being a recent case in point. This blind faith is not groundless faith. It is
grounded in factual considerations. To speak metaphorically, it has a solid basis, a firm foundation, but it cannot
see how the present details will result in the final outcome, nor can it fully perceive what the finished building will
be. To speak colloquially, it sees the forest, but it cannot see how the individual trees make up the forest. Those
who falter in the faith can’t see the forest for the trees. They get so involved in the details of the problem that they
lose sight of the situation as a whole.
       Therefore, by blind faith, I do not mean an irrational faith. Rather, I mean faith as described in Heb 1:1: “Now
faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.” Paul said something similar in
Rom 8:24-25: “For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one also hope for
what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it.” From this vantage
point, if you can see something, you do not have to have faith that it exists. The faith being described in these
passages is trust when you cannot see the outcome for which you hope. Faith and hope, from this vantage point,
presuppose the absence of sight.
       If right here and right now I could see why Coy’s death makes sense, then I would not have to have faith that
it makes sense because I would be able see why it makes sense. If you can see the reason, you do not have to have
faith that there is a reason because you know the reason. If you can perceive the reason, you do not have to accept
reason in faith since you can accept it by sight. If you can see the temporal rationale, you do not have to have faith
that a temporal rationale exists because you can see the temporal rationale. You would not have to hope that it
makes sense in the here-and-now because you could see how it makes sense in the here-and-now. Contrariwise,
when something is seemingly senseless from your limited temporal vantage point, and yet God tells you that it
makes sense from His advantage point, then, if you are going to believe God, you have to have faith that it makes
sense even though you cannot see how it does so.

       When defining faith in these terms, we must conclude that, from God’s unlimited advantage point, God does
not have faith. He can see the outcome, so He does not have to have faith as to what the outcome will be. He can
see the end from the beginning (Is 46:10), so He is not operating in faith regarding how the story will end. He is not
working in blind faith that it will make sense because He already sees how it makes sense. In fact, given God’s
omniscience, He cannot operate in faith when faith is defined in such a way so as to preclude sight. Since He can
see how it will work out for the good, He does not have to have faith that it will work out for the good because He
can see how it will work out for the good. God can see the good outcome; we cannot. Thus, we are called upon to
do what God cannot, to accept it in faith.19
       Imagine watching a movie, such as It’s a Wonderful Life. While watching the movie for the first time, you
do not see how it is possibly going to work out for a good ending. Yet you watch the movie in anticipation that it
will have a happy ending because it is a classic Christmas movie, known for having a happy ending. You have faith
in the happy ending, even though you cannot see how it will have a happy ending beforehand. Even so, your faith
in its happy ending is well grounded in what you have heard about the movie. Suppose, though, that you are
watching the movie again as a rerun for the umpteenth time. You know exactly how the movie will end and how
the details work out for a happy ending. You are not watching the movie in faith that it will have a happy ending.
You are watching it in the knowledge that it will have a happy ending.
       For those who love God, tragedies that are seemingly senseless operate in a similar manner as watching a
movie. Those who love God are watching the movie of their life in real time for the first time. They cannot see how
it will possibly have a happy ending. Still, they trust God, the producer of the movie, that it will have a happy
ending. Their faith is well grounded in what they know about the producer of their movie.
       At present, in the temporal here-and-now, God does not want us to operate from His advantage point because
He does not want us to see how it will work out. For if we could see how it would work out, we would not need
faith. And faith is crucially important to please God: “Without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes
to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him” (Heb 11:6). Therefore, God wants
us to operate in the dark, so to speak, so that we cannot see how it all will work for the good from our limited
vantage point, so that we can have faith in His unlimited advantage point. We cannot see the outcome. However,
we can trust Him that He sees the outcome and has acted wisely and lovingly in allowing the tragedy to occur.
       Consequently, the answer to the why-question I immediately perceived when this stillbirth occurred was that
the reason God allowed Satan to try our faith in this manner was to maximize pain and thereby our faith. Ironically,
our inability to provide a rational answer as to why God would allow this stillbirth provided a rational answer as to
why He allowed it. By putting us in a position where we could see no immediate, short-term answer, God put us in
a position that would maximize our pain and thus our faith, thereby maximizing our beauty, if we would just trust
Him.
       God allowed the freakish, late term stillbirth of a perfectly healthy child because doing so would maximize
our pain and thus maximize the amount of trust we would have to have in Him to get through the trial without
distrusting Him.20 Doing so would maximize our misthological beauty. Having this answer does not mean that I
liked the answer or that it took the pain away. Far from it! We are not expected to like the trials, but we are expected
to accept them and be trained by them and thus be made more beautiful as a result as we trust the Lord (our producer)
with them (Heb 11:5-11). Just as in sports: no pain, no gain; so in life: no pain, no misthological beauty. The greater
the pain, the bigger the pearl and the greater the beauty. Greater pain would necessitate greater faith.
19
   To be sure, God can operate in faith when He chooses. For example, when Jesus lived on Earth, He volitionally
chose to limit His divine prerogatives, such as His foresight, so that He could live by faith.
       As an aside, defining faith as sightless persuasion is not the only way to define faith. Trust would be another
possible way to describe having faith. God chooses to entrust some believers with certain responsibilities. We might
say that God has faith in these believers. He trusts them to carry out those responsibilities, such as responding in
faith to the trials He allows to come their way. On the other hand, God does not entrust some believers with certain
tasks. For example, Jesus did not entrust immature believers with mature knowledge of Himself (Jn 2:23-25). God
does not entrust greater responsibilities to those believers who have been unfaithful with lesser responsibilities
(Lk 16:11). He may trust/entrust immature believers at lesser levels, but He does not trust/entrust them much as He
does responsible believers. God is trusting Jeremy and Lindsi with this severe trial because they have proven
trustworthy. Successfully enduring it will increase their trustworthiness and beauty.

                                          Greater Comfort
        My inability to see a micro answer increased my trust in the macro answer. Trusting God would be easier if
I could see a micro answer. That lack of micro sight made trusting God harder and the pain deeper. The deeper pain
also necessitated something in addition to stronger faith. Deeper pain requires stronger comfort. A classic passage
in this regard comes from Paul, a man who knew what it was to suffer:
      3
       Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;
      4
       who comforts us in all our affliction so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction
      with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. 5 For just as the sufferings of Christ
      are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ. (2Cor 1:3-5).

less than four days of creating the GoFundMe account, over thirty thousand dollars had been raised by over four
hundred donors! Jeremy and Lindsi had sown love in the lives of others, and now they were reaping it abundantly
in the form of contributions, prayers, comments, cards, flowers, food, and videos. Through these means and these
family and friends, God was placing His comforting arms around Jeremy and Lindsi in tangible ways. Did it take
away the pain? No, but it made it a whole lot easier to endure. An old proverb says, “Grief shared is halved; joy
shared is doubled.” Seeing God’s hand at work in supplying the comfort to Jeremy and Lindsi certainly made the
affliction more bearable for Dianne and me. Having a firm theological foundation regarding suffering is great to
build upon. And family and friends were doing everything they could to supply the bricks to make building easier.
This outpouring of love for our children certainly made it easier for Dianne and me to sense God’s comfort as we
read the comments being posted at GoFundMe and looked at the names being added in their support.

                                               Stand Firm
      Dealing with suffering necessarily involves spiritual warfare. Peter exhorts:
      8
        Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls about like a roaring lion, seeking
      someone to devour. 9 But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering
      are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world. 10 And after you have suffered for a
      little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect,
      confirm, strengthen and establish you. (1Pet 5:8-10)

Likewise, Paul exhorts:
      11
         Put on the full armor of God, that you may be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.
      12
         For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the
      world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
      13
         Therefore, take up the full armor of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having
      done everything, to stand firm. 14 Stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and
      having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 15 and having shod your feet with the preparation of
      the gospel of peace; 16 in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to
      extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one. 17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword
      of the Spirit, which is the word of God. (Eph 6:11-17)

      In his April Showers that Jeremy emailed us, he appropriately had this aspiration for Coy:

      He was to be my superhero buddy but stand firm for the King. He was the one to make me proud but
      truly to be the one that could lead his family one day and maybe even sing.

When my sons were small, I had the same aspirations for them as Jeremy did for Coy. Every night I would get on
my knees beside their beds and pray a prayer of spiritual warfare for them and over them.

In their room, I had a large picture by Ron DiCianni hanging on the wall entitled Spiritual Warfare depicting this
battle. Outside of the window in the painting, you can faintly detect a holy angel warding off an unholy angel.

      On the nursery wall, Jeremy had placed four superhero pictures with Bible verses in preparation for his little
superhero buddy, depicting how his son could be a spiritual superhero.
Page 32                                                                                              In Memory of Coy
                                         Illustration 11. Superhero Sword




         The sword in our spiritual warfare is the Scripture. Among the toddler books Jeremy had placed in the
bookshelf on the wall in the nursery was the toddler’s Bible that Dianne and I had given him when he was a toddler.
It still had Jeremy’s name in it.
         Weeks before, Jeremy had placed two handwritten letters on the door to the nursery expressing his prayer for
the child: one letter if it were a girl, another letter if it were a boy. The prayer for the boy was:

      …Son will believe in Jesus for eternal life. That he would not look to his own “righteousness,” but
      only the words of John 3:16.
      …Son’s future wife would be of like-minded faith. I pray whether she is born yet or not for the Lord
      to protect her physically, mentally, spiritually, and emotionally. I pray for their purity till marriage and
      purity of mine for life. Pray he treats her as a queen of the King and nothing short of that.
      …Son’s character is above reproach and God fearing. Pray his mother and I, through the strength of
      the Holy Spirit, teach him the name of Jesus from day 1 and from there on out.
      …Son will be salt and light in this world. That when people see him, all they truly see is Jesus. Pray
      that he will be a man among men, not for strength, athletics, musical, our talents he may possess, but
      rather because of whom he kneels before.
      …Son will not pass the buck but take responsibility and all areas. Pray for wisdom to discern right
      from wrong and legalism from relationship.
      …Son will hear, when it is all said and done, “Well Done.”
Dealing with Stillbirth                                                                                        Page 33

        Dianne and I had read the letters on the nursery door days before and had been eagerly waiting to learn the
gender of our grandchild and to see inside the nursery. When Jeremy and Lindsi came home Wednesday, the day
after the stillbirth, we went to see them and hug them. We knew that going into the nursery would break our hearts—
seeing what would have been, seeing what was supposed to be one of the happiest days of our lives turned into one
of the saddest days of our lives. Dianne and I walked into the nursery and wept. Jeremy had done a fantastic job
preparing the nursery. The initial reaction would be to say that nothing could have prepared us for this unexpected
loss. But the truth of the matter is that the Lord had prepared each of us for this loss by teaching us to rely on Him
with all areas of our lives. Like David, we had learned to say, “The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart
trusts in Him, and I am helped; therefore my heart exults, and with my song I shall thank Him” (Ps 28:7). We drew
upon His strength immediately and trusted Him completely and were helped to cope with the trial, even to give
thanks. Days later, as I type this, the tears still roll down my face. But the sobs have practically subsided; the tears
are much fewer; and the songs of praise have returned.
        During this entire ordeal, I have not sought to fight back the tears but have let them flow freely. Being strong
in the Lord and standing firm do not equate to suppressing valid expressions of grief in a time befitting grief. Rather,
it means to fight invalid expressions of grief and not allow our grief to determine what we believe. By the power of
the Spirit and by faith in the Scripture, they entail keeping our grief following along on the train rails, so to speak.
By keeping our faith focused on the facts, we keep our emotions from derailing our train. We are to live by faith,
not by emotions. Jesus endured the cross for the joy set before Him (Heb 12:2). He did not like the cross. He did
not enjoy the suffering. Neither do we. Still, we too will endure our cross for the joy set before us.

                                                Conclusion
       All those who believe in Christ for eternal life as a free gift will enter Heaven. The joy set before us for
enduring is not the joy of entering Heaven. All believers, even those who allow their emotions to derail their faith,
will enter Heaven. All believers, even those who become embittered against God, will enter Heaven. All believers,
even those who do not take up their cross and follow Christ, will enter Heaven. The joy set before us, if we will
stand firm, far exceeds the joy of simply entering Heaven.
       For many years, I have been researching and writing about the distinction between entering Heaven as a free
gift given to all believers versus the superlative joy of living in the Heavenly City as a reward limited to believers
who endure the trials set before them. I have written numerous books explaining the distinction. Heaven is a lot
bigger than this one City. Those believers who stand firm in the Lord will live with the Lord in this City and
experience all the surpassing joys and privileges pertaining thereto as their eternal reward. Those believers who do
not stand firm will live outside the Heavenly City. Comparatively and metaphorically speaking, living outside the
City is called the outer darkness in Scripture. Other writers, such as Charles Stanley in his book Eternal Security,
likewise, have correctly perceived that the outer darkness is a reward issue. This City has various names and titles:
Heavenly City, Heavenly Jerusalem, The Jerusalem Above, New Jerusalem, Reward City.
       This book ends with an exhortation—not only to those believers affected personally by this tragedy regarding
Coy but to other believers affected by similar tragedies—stand firm! Let the realization as to what is at stake give
you strength. Since this book is in memory of Coy, it will close by focusing on that application.
       Coy is in Heaven. Not only is he in Heaven, he is in New Jerusalem. Not only is he in New Jerusalem, he is
in the part of New Jerusalem known as Infant Paradise. He is being lovingly attended to, not only by loving angels
but also by loving saints who live in New Jerusalem, which would include loving great grandparents who already
have departed to be with the Lord. These great grandparents who are there holding him in that City can do so
because they are believers who stood firm in the Lord during their earthly trials. Life was not always easy for them.
Yet they faced their trials and stood firm. As a result, as part of their heavenly reward, they are now living in the
Heavenly City where they have free access to hold their great grandchild. If we want the same privilege of having
free access to hold Coy in that Reward City, then we too must stand firm. Much is at stake, but our reward will be
great. So stand firm!21

  In an email to the staff at the high school where Jeremy teaches, he ended by affirming that Lindsi’s “strength
has been on center stage and the performance is worthy of a standing ovation.” Personal correspondence, 4/27/2020.
One day Coy will be among those giving Lindsi that standing ovation at the Judgment Seat of Christ.
                                                Postscript
        Isaiah talks of the time when the Lord will comfort all those in Zion, giving them a crown of beauty for the
ashes (Is 61:2-3; TM). Mount Zion is referred to multiple times in Isaiah, and this promise of a crown of beauty in
place of their ashes is particularly appropriate to those who dwell in the heavenly Mount Zion, that is, New
Jerusalem. To those living there, the promise is made: “He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes” (Rev 21:4).
Those living there will have the crown of life and are described in terms of bridal beauty (Rev 19:7-8; 21:2-4,9-11).
Thoughts about the implications of such promises were going through my mind as Dianne and I went to hold the
ashes of our grandson. We never got to hold him, just his ashes. The day will come when the Lord will trade these
ashes and our tears of grief for a garland of joy, and we will be able to hold our beautiful grandson. We will have
been made more beautiful by the Lord through the grief we have endured. Therefore, we are instructed to “consider
it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials” (Jam 1:2). We are not commanded, however, to “feel it
all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials.” No one likes the trials. They hurt. Yet they are necessary
to create the beautiful masterpiece God is painting. Coy’s ashes will be part of that masterpiece. Just Be Held, by
Casting Crowns, is particularly meaningful in this regard:

                                            Hold it all together
                                      Everybody needs you strong
                                     But life hits you out of nowhere
                                    And barely leaves you holding on

                                    And when you’re tired of fighting
                                        Chained by your control
                                     There’s freedom in surrender
                                        Lay it down and let it go

                  So when you’re on your knees and answers seem so far away
                       You’re not alone, stop holding on and just be held
                      Your world’s not falling apart, it’s falling into place
                      I’m on the throne, stop holding on and just be held
                                   Just be held, just be held

                                     If your eyes are on the storm
                                   You’ll wonder if I love you still
                                   But if your eyes are on the cross
                             You’ll know I always have and I always will

                                        And not a tear is wasted
                                       In time, you’ll understand
                                  I’m painting beauty with the ashes
                                        Your life is in My hands
