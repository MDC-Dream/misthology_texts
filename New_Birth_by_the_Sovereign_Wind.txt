1. The Race of Grace—introductory book in which performance-related
    themes (such as perseverance) are considered essential for rewards in
    heaven. Entrance into heaven, in contrast, is regarded as free. A strong
    defense of unconditional security derived from believers being given to
    Jesus is a particular strength of this book.
2. Is Heaven a Gift or a Reward?—while some assert that heaven is a
    reward in some sense, this book maintains that regarding heaven itself
    as a gift is best.
3. Breaking the Rocking Horse—introductory book regarding the
    distinction between having eternal life as a gift versus obtaining it as a
    reward. An overview of the outer darkness and an exegetical treatment
    of the parable of the soils are this book’s primary strengths.
4. Mere Christianity and Moral Christianity—a more comprehensive
    discussion regarding perseverance (and other performance-related
    themes) as being needed for rewards in heaven rather than for entrance
    into heaven. This book provides both introductory material and
    advanced treatments.
5. Woolly Wolves and Woolless Sheep—a rejection of the notion that
    profession of salvation is proven genuine by the way a person lives. This
    book focuses on the parable of the sheep and the goats and shows the
    inadequacy of conditional security in interpreting this parable.
6. Sheep and Goats—an advanced discussion of the parable of the sheep
    and goats that evaluates four interpretations that are compatible with
    unconditional security.
7. Sealed and Secure—a thorough defense of a popular argument for
    unconditional security that also defends the premise of unconditional
    promises.
8. Fallen from Grace but Not from Perfection—an advanced defense of
    unconditional security which affirms that believers can fall from grace
    but not fall from perfection.
9. Salvation—a study of how the verb save and the noun salvation are used
    in the NT. A comprehensive chart of NT usage is provided.
10. Believe—an aspectual defense of unconditional security that examines
    how the verb believe is used in the Gospel of John. A comprehensive
    chart of metaphors for believe in the Gospel of John is provided also.
11. Carnal Corinth—an affirmation of the categorical existence of carnal
    Christians within the Corinthian epistles.
12. The Outer Darkness—a magnum opus that ties together the author’s
    arguments for unconditional security and conditional rewards.

      Marrowists versus Calvinists
       Introduction
        What must a person do to be born again? Nothing! Absolutely nothing!
These were the answers insisted upon by our church that Sunday morning: There
is nothing that a person can do to be born again; God sovereignly decides who
will be born again.
        The flipside of the perspective, which was not pointed out, however, is
that, within this scheme of things, God also sovereignly decides who will not be
born again. By referring to God’s sovereignty, those in our class meant that God
decided who would go to heaven (versus hell) independently of any response on
the part of those selected by God. In other words, God has conditioned entering
heaven upon a person being born again and sovereignly has decided that most
people will not be born again. He did not elect to make salvation possible for the
nonelect. These nonelect have no chance of going to heaven, and there is
nothing that they can do about it, nor is there anything that God is willing to do
about it. Such is the doctrine of Calvinism, which our church was teaching. I
object.

       Occasion
         The occasion on which our church chose to propagate this teaching
was October 21, 2012. I had been attending this church for well over a year
because the majority of the time my brother, Phil (a truly gifted teacher), had
been teaching the Sunday School class I was attending, and I enjoy his
teaching. (He is not a Calvinist by the way.) However, our pastor decided
that we should spend a few months listening to a series of lessons by Sinclair
Ferguson, entitled: Who is the Holy Spirit.
         From personal conversation with our pastor, I knew that our pastor
holds to the Calvinistic doctrine described above, which places new birth
(i.e., regeneration) before faith. However, it had not occurred to me that the
DVD series would promote this perspective. Naively, I assumed that our
pastor would keep his Calvinism in the closet. Thus I was content to listen to
the DVD series, even though it meant I was no longer hearing my brother
teach. After all, even good teachers need a break, and I am open to learning
from others.
         The Sunday morning before we were to hear this teaching on
regeneration, however, I happened to glance ahead in Ferguson’s study
manual. Those attending the Sunday School class had been provided these
booklets, so my wife and I had a copy. I noticed that in the next lesson
Ferguson would be presenting the Calvinistic position: placing regeneration
before faith and grounding God’s selection for regeneration in His
sovereignty, independent of the human response (which typically presumes
Page 2                                           New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
                          1
unconditional election). I told my brother, who is an elder in the church,
that this would be an explosive teaching.

         Explosion
       Our pastor was out of town the next Sunday when this DVD lesson
was shown. But when our pastor originally had introduced the DVD series
several weeks before, he had praised it as being a terrific presentation.
Looking back now, I can see why he might think so, given that it introduces
his Calvinistic perspective, which places regeneration before faith.
Unfortunately, in doing so, it necessarily depicts God as sovereignly


1
  According to Ferguson, “The Spirit regenerates...after which they are able to
follow the call of John 3:16 to believe in Jesus and have eternal life” (p. 32).
Apparently, Ferguson’s order would be: regeneration → believe → eternal life.
Some scholastic Calvinists basically break regeneration into two parts and
would consider being born again in Jn 3:3-5 to be the first phase. Given
Ferguson’s lack of emphasis regarding the supposed two-phase aspect of being
given spiritual life and the lack of such distinction by our pastor on the occasion
when my brother and I discussed this matter with him over breakfast some time
earlier, I will not limit my response to this perspective in the current discussion.
        In placing regeneration before faith and eternal life after faith, Ferguson
has opened up his Calvinistic position to even further criticism. See my book,
Ordo Salutis for additional response to the two-phased approach. However,
since many Calvinists would acknowledge that salvation is by faith and yet
place regeneration before faith, I will not bother refuting Ferguson in this
present discussion by quoting verses that teach that salvation is by faith, even
though he states that “salvation rests in the hands of God alone” so that
“salvation originates from the sovereign choice of God alone” (p. 31). He
thereby insinuates that salvation is not by faith. Careful Calvinists, in contrast,
would acknowledge that being saved in terms of having eternal life is by faith
(Jn 3:16-17). Rather than pursue these weaknesses in Ferguson’s limited
argument, the fundamental and universal Calvinistic weakness that I will focus
upon in this present study is the end result of the Calvinistic contention, which is
that only those unconditionally elected can be saved. Regardless as to whether a
dual-phased or mono-phased Calvinistic regeneration is proposed, the
Calvinistic God will not make salvation possible for the nonelect.
        My working premise will presume a singular impartation of spiritual life
to the believer so that regeneration is the impartation of eternal life via the
new birth experience. As a corollary, since eternal life is received by faith, then
so is regeneration. Accordingly, the new birth experience is conditioned on faith.
Most importantly, because faith is the condition for regeneration in my
Marrowistic proposal, election to salvation is not unconditional. Salvation, as
well as election to salvation, is conditioned on faith.
Marrowists Versus Calvinists                                           Page 3
deciding who will and will not be born again—apart from any faith on their
part.
       Thus, that Sunday morning, in secession 8, “A Heavenly Birth,”
Ferguson’s presentation posed the typical Calvinistic view in which
regeneration is placed before faith. His presentation dealt primarily with
Jn 3:1-16. In the discussion period following the presentation, I asked,
“What is the condition for regeneration?” The Sunday School leader, who
was taking the discussion questions, said that he did not understand the
question. So I reworded it, “What do we have to do to be born again?” He
responded that there is nothing that we can do to be born again because God
does it sovereignly. His response was true to Ferguson’s Calvinistic position
that had been presented in the DVD and study manual.
       Next, I asked how one would reconcile this Reformed interpretation
of Jn 3:8 with Jn 3:16. In these verses, Jesus teaches the following:

•   The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not
    know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is
    born of the Spirit (Jn 3:8).
•   For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that
    whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life
    (Jn 3:16).

        According to Ferguson, the picture in v. 8 of the Spirit regenerating
us like the wind represents the Spirit doing so sovereignly. Any tree leaves
being blown by the wind are under the control of the wind. Obviously, the
wind is not under the control of the leaves. Supposedly, this proves that the
Spirit regenerates whomever He wishes, independently of any response from
them. According to this premise, there is nothing we can do that would result
in the Spirit regenerating us.
        Subsequently, Ferguson proceeded to quote Jn 3:16. But let me stress
the word whoever within this verse: “For God so loved the world, that He
gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish,
but have eternal life.” The impression naturally conveyed by the verse is that
whoever in the world who hears the message conveyed by this verse may
believe in Jesus Christ (for eternal life) and thereby receive eternal life.
        This verse is, of course, central to one’s understanding of what it
means to believe in Jesus. If one’s belief in Jesus does not meet the criteria
set forth in this verse, then one is not a believer in Jesus in the sense
conveyed by this verse. One is still under judgment (Jn 3:17). So a correct
understanding of this verse (Jn 3:16), which is often referred to as “the
gospel in a nutshell,” is crucial.
Page 4                                         New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
                        Illustration 1. Biblical Verse




       I love this verse. Like so many others, I was very pleased to see Tim
Tebow put the reference to this beloved verse under his eyes during the ball
game. The impression I get from Tebow’s action and from the fans reaction,
as well as from the verse itself, is that anyone in the stands or in front of
their TV sets who reads this verse is being given a legitimate opportunity to
believe in Jesus for eternal life. God was not using Tebow to run a fake in
order to fool the fans into thinking that they could have eternal life if they
believed in Jesus, when in fact they could not.
                   Illustration 2. Calvinistic Interpretation
Marrowists Versus Calvinists                                                 Page 5
       I am also happy to note that Tebow did not put in fine print below the
biblical reference, “Only applicable to the Calvinistic elect” or in the next
game follow up with, “Loved...if elected.” Contrary to Calvinists, Jn 3:16
does not limit the possible reception of eternal life to those whom are
sovereignly and unconditionally chosen by God’s election. My stance is that
anyone can have eternal life if they will trust in Christ for such life. Such is
the genuine offer in Jn 3:16. The offer by God (and hence by Tebow) in
Jn 3:16 is legitimate. Eternal life is offered genuinely to whoever will believe
in Jesus for eternal life.2
       This straightforward understanding of Jn 3:16 poses significant
problems for Ferguson’s interpretation of Jn 3:8, however. First, as I
inquired in my follow-up questions, how would those adopting Ferguson’s
position reconcile his quotation of Jn 3:16 with his interpretation of Jn 3:8?
On the one hand, Ferguson seems to allow that eternal life is universally
available in v. 16. On the other hand, his teaching, that God sovereignly
chooses who will believe, limits the availability of eternal life to those whom
God sovereignly and unconditionally has chosen “before the foundation of
the world” (Eph 1:4). God’s selection, supposedly, was made independently
of their belief in Jesus.
       But I must ask, “Did God actually decide that He would not love the
whole world, in the manner described by Jn 3:16, before He created the
world?” Some of those defending Ferguson’s interpretation of this verse
during the ensuing discussion certainly seemed to think that God’s love, as
described in Jn 3:16, is applicable only to the elect, quoting Eph 1:4 as
supposed proof of this Calvinistic contention.
       After all, given Ferguson’s position, how can it be said that God loves
the whole world in the manner described by Jn 3:16, when his Calvinistic
model only makes salvation possible to those whom God sovereignly has

2
  According to 1Tim 1:16, we believe in Jesus for eternal life. In this verse, we
do not believe in Him because of eternal life. Mono-phased Calvinism would
pose otherwise and say that we believe because we have eternal life (i.e.,
because of eternal life, not for eternal life) and impose this inverted order onto
Jn 3:16. Although I would agree with Calvin that the possession of eternal life
ensures that the regenerate will continue to believe at the regenerate core of their
being, I disagree with Calvinists that such ongoing belief is necessary to secure
the retention of eternal life. Moreover, I find it ironic that they maintain that one
must continue to believe in order to keep eternal life, and yet they deny that one
must believe in order to receive eternal life. For such technical matters, see my
writings elsewhere. Here, I simply note that the impression clearly conveyed by
Scripture is that the unregenerate believe in Christ for eternal life, that is, in
order to receive eternal life. The possibility that regeneration subsequently
results in faith is a deduction that is far removed from the proposition being
posed in Jn 3:16 and the preposition being used in 1Tim 1:16.
Page 6                                        New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
chosen independently of their faith in Jesus? At this point, many Calvinists
simply will deny that God loves the whole world in the manner described in
Jn 3:16. But Ferguson did not address the issue, so I brought it up in the
discussion following the presentation.
       Our discussion leader did not have an answer. However, a retired
missionary in our church responded to my questions by affirming the
Calvinistic position—that there is no condition that we can meet for
regeneration. She then tried to offset my concerns by quoting 2Pet 3:9,
affirming the biblical truth that God is “not wishing for any to perish.”
   Illustration 3. The Calvinistic God does not Wish for the Elect to Perish




        I confirmed that I believe 2Pet 3:9. Truly, God does not wish for any
to perish. However, I would take Jn 3:16 as asserting this same truth as well.
So I inquired further as to how she reconciled her quote of 2Pet 3:9 with her
belief that God sovereignly chooses who will and will not perish apart from
any response from them. If, as her perspective requires, God is not willing to
make salvation possible for all, then how can she claim that her
interpretation of Jn 3:8 allows that God is not “wishing for any to perish”?
How did the biblical God not wishing for any to perish become the
Calvinistic God wishing only for the elect not to perish? How did the
biblical God not wishing for any to perish become the Calvinistic God
wishing for the nonelect to perish? Her emphatic and repeated answer was,
“That’s your problem.”

Marrowists Versus Calvinists                                             Page 7
      Somehow, her inability to reconcile her interpretation of one passage
with her interpretation of the other passage was stated by her to be my
problem. In short, her answer to her inconsistencies was to say repeatedly,
“That’s your problem.” This was her only answer to her inconsistencies. Not
much of an answer is it?
                         Illustration 5. Your Problem!




       Problem
        Basically, I was asking how she would reconcile her interpretation of
Jn 3:8 with her interpretation of Jn 3:16. Essentially, her only answer was
that it was my problem. Frankly, at that time, I could not see how her
inability to provide a coherent answer for her position was my problem.
Nevertheless, it is not difficult to explain either her inconsistencies or to
provide an answer that is consistent. As to her Calvinistic position, the
Calvinistic God has not made salvation possible for all because He does not
genuinely desire the salvation of all.3 For Calvinists, the nonelect are
doomed from the womb, as Calvin believed, and there is nothing the nonelect
can do about it and nothing God is willing to do about it.
        In contradistinction to such Calvinists, (as a contemporary Marrowist)
I believe that, according to passages such as Jn 3:16, God has made salvation
possible for all humanity.4 The door of new birth (and thus to heaven) is

  To be sure, I provide far more extensive discussion in my book, The Outer
Darkness. But this is the bottom line.

  For an excellent discussion of early Marrowists, see http://www.faithalone.org
/journal/2003ii/makidon.pdf. I am a contemporary Marrowist in that I do not
base my assurance on my performance; rather, I view perseverance as necessary
for rewards within heaven rather than for entrance into heaven. From the
Page 8                                           New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
open to everyone who has been born on this planet if they will believe in
Jesus for eternal life. How, then, does one reconcile my interpretation of
Jn 3:16 with Jn 3:8?
       To begin with, using the analogy of faith, one interprets an unclear
verse in light of a clearer verse. In this case, one interprets Jn 3:8 in harmony
with the clearer understanding available in Jn 3:16. This principle is really
an implementation of common sense. Even today, when an author makes
two statements about a matter and one statement is hard to understand, you
naturally should seek to understand the more difficult statement by means of
the clearer statement. Undeniably, Jn 3:16 is the clearer of these two verses.
Ferguson inverted the analogy of faith in order to invert the order within
Jn 3:16. He used an unclear verse to misinterpret a clear verse. He tried to
find the small print in the contract/context, so to speak, so as to overturn the
clear promise of Jn 3:16.

         Sovereign Wind
      For sake of argument, allow me to assume that Ferguson is
fundamentally correct in thinking that Jn 3:8 pictures the Spirit sovereignly
regenerating whomever He wishes so that the passage is picturing new birth
by the sovereign wind.5 After all, Jesus states, “The Son also gives life to

inception, Calvinists have been highly antagonistic toward Marrowists since
Marrowism allows absolute assurance; whereas, Calvinism, of necessity, makes
assurance dependent upon performance.
5
  Understandably, Lenski would have issues with the Ferguson-type approach:
“Sometimes this [wind] illustration has been misapplied by commentators
because they fail to discover the point of the comparison....and then speak of the
free and unrestricted working of the Spirit. This misconception often becomes
serious, for it easily leads to the false dogmatical idea that the Spirit regenerates
this or that man at random, passing over the rest.” Lenski addresses this
misperception by stating, “The fact that all who are thus reached by the Spirit
[through means of the word] are not reborn is not due to a lack of saving will on
the part of the Spirit...but to the wicked and permanent resistance of those who
remain unregenerate. Matt. 23:37; Acts 7:51-53; 13:46” (John, 243). Although
Lenski’s criticism is certainly applicable to Ferguson’s presentation, I am,
nevertheless, allowing as much credibility to Ferguson’s questionable position
as possible in my discussion, without doing violence to the context. Yet I am
still easily able to demonstrate the objectionable character of his conclusion. As
Govett also would point out in commenting on Jn 3:8: “The answer is not—
‘You cannot be saved, save by the sovereign work of the Holy Ghost, for which
you must wait [for] God’s time; and perhaps after all your waiting, you are to
perish as being not one of His elect”; rather, God’s purpose is “to grant salvation
to all who will seek it” (John, 90; emphasis his). The shortcomings of
Ferguson’s type of approach are well known within the scholarly community.
Marrowists Versus Calvinists                                              Page 9
                               6
whom He wishes” (Jn 5:21). Let the question now be posed, “Whom has
the Spirit sovereignly decided to regenerate?” From Jn 3:16, I would pose
that the Spirit has decided to regenerate whoever believes in Jesus for eternal
life.
         Calvinists will shriek at such an answer. “How can the leaves
determine where the wind will blow?” would be a Ferguson-type retort,
“You cannot make the Spirit’s decision contingent upon our response and
still claim that He is sovereign!”
         A counterclaim from my perspective, however, could explain just as
easily: “God sovereignly decided to regenerate whoever believes.” The
wind, representing the Spirit, has decided not to obligate Himself to blow on
(i.e., regenerate) those leaves who stubbornly do not wish to be blown on or
who persist in their wish to blow themselves. In other words, if you
obstinately wish to stay in a state of unbelief or Pharisaically (i.e.,
legalistically) persist in trying to work your way to heaven, God is under no
obligation to regenerate you. With His promise in Jn 3:16, God sovereignly
and graciously has chosen only to obligate Himself to give eternal life to
those who believe.

       Condition
         Faith is the condition for eternal life in Jn 3:16. The intent, and hence
implicit promise, of Jn 3:16 is that those who believe in Christ for eternal
life will be given eternal life. This verse does not promise faith to those who
have eternal life. Rather, it promises eternal life to those who respond in
faith to the promise of eternal life. Accordingly, faith is the condition for
regeneration. Contrary to Ferguson, to our discussion leader, and to the
retired missionary, faith is the only condition for eternal life (and thus for
new birth) within this passage.
         New birth pictures new life—eternal life. This new life, called eternal
life, is imparted via new birth. Regeneration (new birth) is the impartation of
eternal life. Contextually, it is conditioned on faith. At the very least, seeing
the kingdom (Jn 3:3) entails entering the kingdom (Jn 3:5). The only way to
see the kingdom from the inside is to enter the kingdom through faith.7
Consequently, according to Jesus, just as you must believe in order to have
eternal life, you must believe in order to enter the kingdom. Jesus’

6
  To whom does the Son wish to give life? This question is answered, in context,
three verses later: “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and
believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life” (Jn 5:24). Yet again the sequence is:
hear → believe → life. Jesus most certainly is not saying, “He who has eternal
life will hear and believe.” He is crystal clear on the sequence: “Those who hear
shall live” (Jn 5:25). The sequence is: hear → live, not live → hear.

   See Believe to See, 45.
Page 10                                          New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
contextual sequence is simple: faith → birth/life → enter/see. Jesus is the
door into the kingdom (Jn 14:6). We enter the kingdom through faith in
Him. We are sealed in Him, and thus transferred into the kingdom, as a
result of coming to Him in faith (Eph 1:13). As a result of coming to Him in
faith, we are granted the water of life, picturing eternal life and thus
regeneration (Jn 4:10-14; 7:37-38; Rev 22:17). We get eternal life by
believing in Christ (Jn 20:31).8

8
  In The Outer Darkness, I provide examples where the first hina clause should
be rendered differently than the second hina clause. In the case of Jn 20:31, the
first hina denotes purpose, while the second hina shows purpose-result. Thus I
would translate this verse as: “These have been written in order that [hina] you
may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and in order that as a result
of [hina] believing you would have life in His name” (Jn 20:31; TM). The intent
of the writing is so that the unbeliever may believe. The guarantee of the
writing is that those who do believe would/will have eternal life. Because having
eternal life is the result of believing, I normally translate the second occurrence
(i.e., hina plus pisteuo) in this verse as by believing...would: “These have been
written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that
by believing you would have life in His name” (Jn 20:31; TM). This by-would
combination is less cumbersome than translating it as: “And in order that as a
result of [hina] believing you would have life in His name.”
      Contrary to Wallace (GGBB, 472-473), who recognizes the distinction
between purpose clauses and purpose-result clauses but fails to denote that
distinction with his glosses, I use the following glosses for present clarification:
      • Purpose: in order that (or so that, contra GGBB).
      • Result: as a result of (cp. with the result that/of, GGBB, 473, 638).
      • Purpose-Result: in order that as a result of.
Yet this level of specificity for the result clause, much less for the purpose-
result clause, is cumbersome for most translational purposes. Thus other means
may be implemented to convey that meaning for result, such as: by...would/will.
Since eternal life comes as a result of believing, it comes by believing.
Therefore, those translations that use by as a gloss to bring out the meaning of
the verse are to be commended (CJB, CSB, ESV, NET, NIB, NIV, NLT);
through is also an appropriate gloss (NAB, NRS). Eternal life comes by/through
believing, that is, as a result of believing.
         The implicit order of the parallel in Jn 3:14-15 is: lifted → look → live.
The explicit order in Jn 3:16 is: gave → believe → life. Just as one does not
have an extension of life before one looks, so one does not have eternal life
before one believes. Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness in order that
those who looked would live as a result of his lifting and their looking. Likewise,
God gave His Son to die for us on the cross in order that those who believe
would have eternal life as a result of His giving and their believing. Just as one
look resulted in an extension of life in the OT typological counterpart, so
punctiliar faith results in eternal life.

        According to Calvinists, the condition for regeneration is
unconditional election. According to John, the condition for regeneration is
that you believe in Jesus for eternal life. The two systems of thought are
completely incompatible.
        Consequently, such Calvinists stand Jn 3:1-16 on its head, in terms of
its sequence,9 and they deny the import of Jn 3:16, with their implications.
Within Calvinism, the promise within the verse for whosoever will becomes
limited to whosoever God elects. If God did not elect you to believe
savingly,10 then you are damned hopelessly, and there is nothing you can do
about it. In what appears to be a willy-nilly fashion, the Calvinistic God
chooses to regenerate some and to leave the rest helplessly to their fate. This
fatalistic theology twists Jn 3:16 to mean: “For God so loved the elect, that

        For further confirmation of the relational sequence being posed by the
present discussion, see Jn 5:40, for example, where we need to come to Christ
(i.e., believe in Christ) in order that [hina] we would have eternal life as a
result: believe → life. We receive eternal life by believing, not before believing.
Additionally, eating (picturing believing) is the condition for eternal life in
Jn 6:51. Thus the conditional relationship is: believe ⇒ life. For further
discussion, see my books: Ordo Salutis and The Outer Darkness.
9
  The biblical sequence in Jn 1:12-13 is: believe → regeneration. See my article:
http://misthology.org/pdf/articles/Ordo_Salutis.pdf. In short, in order to clarify
the logical relations, one could translate these verses in this manner: “But as
many as received Him, to them (to those who believed in His name) He gave the
change in status necessary to become begotten of God, who were begotten not
of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God”
(Jn 1:12-13; TM). You receive Jesus as your Savior by believing in Him (for
eternal life). As a result, you are given the legal right to become children of God
by being born of God. Legally and spiritually, then, you become a regenerate
child of God as a result of believing in Jesus for eternal life. A two-phased
regeneration is thus ruled out, and mono-phased Calvinism inverts the order in
Jn 3:16. Biblically, regeneration occurs after faith. In this verse, being born of
God’s will means that it is God’s sovereign will to regenerate those who believe.
Believers do not birth themselves. God is the one who births them. That is,
believers do not give themselves eternal life; God is the one who gives them
eternal life.
10
   This disclaimer about believing savingly had to be added because, with their
doctrine of temporary faith, Calvinists will allow that the nonelect might believe
non-savingly (i.e., temporarily). In such a case, the Calvinistic God sovereignly
fools such people into thinking they are saved by causing them to believe
without first regenerating them; therefore, their faith will not persevere. In other
words, the Calvinistic God uses Jn 3:16 to run a fake: Allegedly, believing in
Jesus for eternal life will do no good if the Calvinistic God did not first secretly
ground your faith in regeneration because of His election. Faith that does not
result from regeneration will not result in heaven (so Calvinism).
Page 12                                       New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever God elects will not perish,
but have eternal life and consequently believe in Him.” Calvinism is a
perversion of the Christian message. Regrettably, this perversion was the
gist of our Sunday School presentation that morning.

       Children
      One of my favorite songs that I was taught as a child has the
following well-known refrain:

               Jesus loves the little children,
               All the children of the world.
               Red and yellow, black and white,
               They are precious in His sight,
               Jesus loves the little children of the world.

       Within Calvinism, however, this lovely song, as it relates to Jn 3:16,
undergoes a monstrous metamorphosis, so as to mean something else
entirely:

               Jesus loves some of the children,
               Only the elect ones in the world.
               Red and yellow, black and white,
               Some are precious in His sight,
               Jesus loves only the elect ones in the world.

        At the beginning of our worship service, the children of our church
come up front for a presentation geared especially for them. I doubt that the
Calvinists in our church would want to use this modified version of the song
to indoctrinate the children with their Calvinism. Most Calvinists I have met
prefer not to be so forthright with the logical implications of their theology.
In this way, they can follow what they believe to be God’s example in using
such songs and verses to fool people into thinking that God loves them all so
as to genuinely offer them eternal life, when in fact they do not believe this
to be the case. This ugly implication of Calvinism, or what Bryson would
call its dark side, is normally hidden from public view.

       Elect Ones
       For example, let us suppose that Calvinists wanted to unmask their
theology and teach the above Calvinistically-corrected version of this song
to the children. I can imagine a little child responding, “How do I know if I
am one of the elect ones?” The question is natural enough, but answering it
can be daunting for Calvinists.
Marrowists Versus Calvinists                                              Page 13
       Ferguson probably intended to imply that assurance (i.e., knowing
that you are one of those so loved and elected to go to heaven) is not a
problem for Calvinists. His discussion question number five was:

                You know you have been born again if you believe
         in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?
         a. True
         b. False

       Unfortunately, we never got this far in our discussion session at the
conclusion of Ferguson’s presentation. Most people would probably assume
that the answer is, “True.” Actually, however, if you are a Calvinist, the
correct answer is, “False.” The Calvinistic God might have chosen only to
give you temporary faith, not saving faith. So within their theology, you
have to persevere in order to know that you are one of the elect, and the only
way to know that you are one of the elect is by persevering. If you were not
to persevere, this would prove that you are not one of the elect. So you
cannot be sure you are one of the Calvinistic elect.
       The Calvinistic understanding of Jn 3:16 might be better expressed
as: “For God so loved the elect, that He gave His only begotten Son, that
some in the world will not perish, but have eternal life and consequently
believe in Him.”11 The Calvinistic God does not intend for everyone who
believes in Jesus for eternal life to have eternal life. Their God only gives
eternal life to those whom He unconditionally has elected to receive that life.
Due to their misperception of God, Calvinists must search their lives for
what they hope to consider possible signs of regenerate life, and they cannot
be content with faith as being sufficient evidence. For they cannot trust their
God to have given eternal life to someone just because that person has
believed in Jesus for eternal life.

       Everyone
       Hunt, a non-Calvinist, does well to question the Calvinistic picture of
God’s love with his book: What Love is This? Certainly, the Calvinistic
portrayal of God’s love is actually a betrayal of it. Be that as it may, Hunt
too quickly has criticized White’s translation of Jn 3:16.12 White, a
Calvinist, wants to translate the whoever (pas ho) in this verse as everyone. I

11
   The limitation of God’s love within this verse to the elect is a defect found in
both mono-phased and dual-phased versions of Calvinistic regeneration, as is
the limitation of eternal life to those who believe eternally. The placing of faith
after eternal life within this verse is a fault found arguably, though, only in the
mono-phased version of this system.

   Dave Hunt, What Love is This?, 270-271.
Page 14                                            New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
have no objection to such a translation. The verse does indeed promise that
everyone who believes in Jesus will not perish.13 In fact, the same syntax in
Jn 6:40 would yield: This is the will of My Father, that everyone [pas ho]
who believes in the Son would have eternal life (TM).14 Even more to the
point, the identical phrase in the context immediately preceding Jn 3:16
reads: “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
the Son of Man be lifted up; that whoever [pas ho] believes may in Him
have eternal life” (Jn 3:14-15). Yet this whoever is typically rendered as
everyone in its OT counterpart: “Then the Lord said to Moses, ‘Make a fiery
serpent, and set it on a standard; and it shall come about, that everyone [pas
ho] who is bitten, when he looks at it, he shall live’” (Num 21:8). Whoever =
everyone.
        The real problem is, as Hunt accurately deduces, that White limits the
possibility of savingly believing to the Calvinistic elect.15 When White says
everyone, he really only means some.16 Calvinistically, all the elect who
believe in Jesus equals only some in the world who believe in Jesus.
Contextually, though, and in accord with reality, translating the verse as
everyone opens it up to mean whoever ever. The Calvinist cannot limit
everyone to the Calvinistic elect because many of those who biblically, and
therefore savingly, believe in Jesus for eternal life do not fit the Calvinistic
profile, and yet John includes them in the everyone (see Jn 2:23-25; 8:31-32;
12:42-43).17 Thus, whoever ever is valid.
        Additionally, as Hunt correctly notes, in light of the explanatory gar
that introduces the explanation in the next verse, interpreting world to mean

13
   I have no aversion whatsoever to translating the verse as referring to everyone,
although my preference would be: whoever ever. See my John in Living Color.
14
   Note that Jn 6:40 does not say that the Father’s will is that everyone who has
eternal life will believe; rather, eternal life comes as a result of believing: believe
→ eternal life. Discerning God’s sovereign will pertaining to whom the Spirit
will give life is not an inscrutable mystery. The leaves who believe are given life
by the sovereign wind.

supporting argument, see my “Breakdown of a Calvinistic Stronghold” in The
Outer Darkness and “The Necessity of Drawing (Jn 6:37,44,65)” in my
Drawing and Appointment.

   See Chameleon, 25.
17
   This is not to say that everyone who thinks that he or she is a believer is in
fact a believer. Far from it! The devil has sown many tares in the church who
look like they are wheat (i.e., like believers) and who think that their looking
like wheat (in terms of their affections and actions) proves that they are wheat.
However, believing in one’s performance for eternal life cannot be equated with
believing in Jesus for eternal life (Mt 13:24-42). Just so, one would expect to
find many lost Calvinists within the assembly of genuine believers.
Marrowists Versus Calvinists                                               Page 15
the elect makes no sense in this context. Jesus is not refuting the nonsensical
notion that God would send His Son to judge the elect!18 Accordingly,
contrary to Calvinists, in neither v. 16 nor v. 17 does the world mean the
world of the elect.

       Assurance
       Assurance has been called the Achilles’ heel of Calvinism, and rightly
so. This weakness within their theology is prevalent for a number of reasons.
For one thing, the Bible provides these types of warnings to those currently
believing: “Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall”
(1Cor 10:12). Falling, and thus failure, is a real possibility. You cannot be
absolutely certain that you will not fall. Indeed, just a few verses earlier,
Paul had exhorted:
         3
           And I do all things for the sake of the gospel, that I may
         become a fellow partaker of it. 24 Do you not know that those
         who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run
         in such a way that you may win. 25 And everyone who
         competes in the games exercises self-control in all things.
         They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an
         imperishable. 26 Therefore I run in such a way, as not without

18
   “For [gar] God did not send the Son into the { world [of the elect] to judge
the | world [of the elect], but in order that [hina] the } world [of the elect]
should be saved through Him” (Jn 3:17; TM). Simply reading the verse, in a
manner consistent with the Calvinistic interpretation in this context, shows the
inconsistency of the Calvinistic interpretation regarding the second occurrence
of world. Granted, White attempts to circumvent the Marrowistic interpretation
of Jn 3:17 by posing that hina is a purpose-result clause. In that case, one could
render it: with the result that the world would be saved. Since the entire world is
not saved, the world cannot be everyone, just the elect, or so the argument goes.
Not so. This hina in Jn 3:17 is a purpose clause, properly translated as should.
Contrastively, the hina in Jn 3:16 is, in fact, a purpose-result clause, permissibly
translated as will or would. See footnote 8 herein. For protracted discussion, see
The Outer Darkness. The following gloss would help clarify the resultant nature
of the syntax for Jn 3:16: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, in order that [hina] whoever believes in Him will/would not
perish, but have eternal life as a result” (TM). Alternatively, one might render it
as: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, in order
that as a result of [hina] believing in Him no one would perish, but have eternal
life” (TM). Contextually, this rendering does not prove that everyone will
believe, only that whoever ever believes will never ever perish. Either way,
having eternal life is the purpose of God’s giving and the result of the person’s
believing.
Page 16                                          New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
          aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air; 27 but I buffet
          my body and make it my slave, lest possibly, after I have
          preached to others, I myself should be disqualified.
          (1Cor 9:23-27)

        According to some Calvinists, Paul himself was in danger of being
disqualified from reaching heaven by proving to be one of the nonelect if he
failed to run the race successfully to the end. Paul could not be sure he was
one of the elect. And if he cannot be sure, then neither can anyone else who
has not yet finished the race course, of course. Within Calvinism, in order to
reach heaven, you have to endure to the end (Mt 10:22; 24:13; Mk 13:13). If
you do not persevere, this will prove that you never were elected to begin
with. So just because you believe in Jesus today does not guarantee that you
will believe in Jesus tomorrow. Even if, given such a perspective, your faith
and works are sufficient today to grant you a high degree of probability
about your election, this does little, if anything, to grant you infallible, long-
term assurance for tomorrow. Run well or burn in hell would summarize
such a Calvinistic perspective. If you stop running, this will prove that you
were never regenerate. You just thought you were. Calvinistic assurance is
necessarily based on the believer’s performance.
        The acronym for Calvinistic theology is TULIP. The U stands for
unconditional election. The part I was objecting to in our discussion that
Sunday morning was how they use their doctrine of unconditional election to
stand Jn 3:16 on its head.
        The P in TULIP stands for perseverance. According to Calvinists, if
you are unconditionally elected, then you will persevere.19 After all, within
their perspective, your getting into heaven is conditioned on your
perseverance. So if God unconditionally elected you, you will persevere,
because God sovereignly has predetermined that you will reach heaven by
persevering. He will not enable the nonelect to persevere, so they don’t
stand a prayer of getting into heaven. Persevere or perish.
        The discussion leader quickly brought the discussion to a close. So I
was not able to bring up a question about assurance. However, after the
discussion had ended, the retired missionary turned around and asked me if I
was born again. I guess she figured that born again people would not
challenge her Calvinism. But I was puzzled. What did my being born again
have to do with her inability to resolve the contradictions within her own

19
   In Calvinism, God elected who would believe. In Marrowism, God elected
those who would believe. The difference is that in Calvinism, God determines
who will believe; whereas, in Marrowism He does not. Also, by way of further
demarcation, Calvinism conditions entrance into heaven on the believers’
perseverance; Marrowism conditions entrance into heaven on God’s
preservation of the believer.
Marrowists Versus Calvinists                                          Page 17
position? And why did she keep saying that her inability to provide a
coherent answer was my problem?
          Illustration 6. Performance-Based versus Promised-Based




        Anyway, I gave up trying to get an answer from her on such matters,
since the only response I was getting from her was her repeated statement
that it was my problem (that she could not answer my question), along with
her repeated questioning as to whether I was born again. So I responded that
I was born again and asked how did she know that she was born again. Her
answer was classic: “Because I love Jesus.” I immediately inquired, “So it is
no longer based on faith?” She reacted with a look of disgust. So I quickly
reminded her, “Jesus said, ‘If you love Me, you will keep My commands’”
(Jn 14:15). Her response here was also classic: “I have kept all His
commandments.”

       Condition
       I was reminded of a rich young ruler who likewise thought he was
going to heaven because he kept all of God’s commands (Mk 10:20). Jesus
set him straight. To do the same for this missionary, one could remind her of
a well-known verse: “All our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment”
(Is 64:6). Basing her assurance of getting into heaven on her performance
would be like offering God filthy garments as reason He should let her into
heaven.
       Suppose this missionary were to die and stand before God, and He
were to say to her, “Why should I let you into My heaven?” What would her
answer be? Evidently, her response would be: “Because I love Jesus and
have kept all His commands.” This is a very precarious answer, however.
Yet she based her assurance of being born again, and thus of entering
heaven, on this very answer.20

20
   This deduction is even more straightforward in its applicability to those
Calvinists who, like John Piper, acknowledge that they condition salvation from
hell on works. In their view, works are viewed as necessary evidence, and the
judgment that determines whether you will go to heaven or hell is according to
your works. For documentation and rebuttal of Piper and Jonathan Edwards on
Page 18                                          New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
      Let us consider another well-known passage that is very popular
among those who, like this missionary, base their assurance on their
performance:
          21
            “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter
          the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of My
          Father who is in heaven. 22 “Many will say to Me on that
          day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and
          in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform
          many miracles?’ 23 “And then I will declare to them, ‘I
          never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice
          lawlessness.” (Mt 7:21-23)

       Here is a group of people who served the Lord and appealed to their
performance as proof that they are saved.21 Talk about opening a can of
worms! One such problem with doing so is that if you appeal to your works
as proof that you are saved, then the Lord can point to your works as proof
that you were never saved. To their surprise, the people in this passage
actually are giving ample reason for our regarding them to be spurious
believers. Yet many Calvinists insist that works prove who is a genuine
believer! These proveitists22 are refuted by their favorite proof text! The
Bible teaches that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God”
(Rom 3:23)—even proveitists.
       The Lord Jesus simply points out this fact to them in this Matthean
passage. As far as reaching heaven is concerned, Jesus emphatically states
that the will of the Father is that we come to Christ in saving faith (Jn 6:37-
40). Therefore, if this passage in Matthew (7:21-23) is dealing with what is

this matter, see my Mere Christianity and Moral Christianity. For judgment
according to works, see my Breaking the Rocking Horse.
21
   They were serving the Lord, but the Lord does not acknowledge them as being
His servants. In the Gospel of Matthew, those whom the Lord regards as His
servants are elect. Some of them are thrown into the outer darkness because of
their poor service. But biblically, the outer darkness refers to loss of reward, not
to eternal damnation. See The Outer Darkness.
22
   Proveitists is a coined abbreviation for prove-it-tists: advocates of prove-it
theology. Many proveitists will object to being calling Calvinists. Perhaps they
are Calminians or closet Calvinists. In any event, the term proveitists is used
broadly to denote those who (like Calvinists) maintain that the way a person
lives proves whether that person is a genuine believer. Proveitism asserts that
fruit in the form of perseverance is necessary proof of salvation: If you do not
have this fruit, then you never were saved initially. Perseverance is necessary to
prove that you are saved and to enter heaven. Calvinists, closet Calvinists, and
Calminians thus would be included under the proveitistic umbrella.
Marrowists Versus Calvinists                                            Page 19
necessary to go to heaven (as proveitists presume), then the conclusion that
should be reached is that they failed to believe in Jesus for eternal life.23 By
their own proveitistic premises, proveitists are prohibited from looking to
Christ alone for eternal life. Consequently, it is no surprise that the Lord
points to their performance as falling way short of what is necessary to reach
heaven.

       Good Joe
       A couple of weeks before this Sunday School episode, I was
attending a kingdom Bible conference. A Calvinist, who was visiting the
conference and sitting in front of me (whom I will refer to as Joe), turned
around during a break and asked me what kingdom conferences are about. I
explained to Joe that we in the kingdom camp believe that whoever believes
in Jesus for eternal life is, thereafter, unconditionally assured of reaching
heaven and that good works are required for rewards within heaven, not for
entrance into heaven.
       Joe quickly turned to Jam 2:14ff and asked me about that passage. I
noted that he already had highlighted save your souls in Jam 1:21 of his
Bible. So I showed from the context that the passage is talking about born-
again believers who need to save their souls from a loss of rewards at the
Bema, that is, at the Judgment Seat of Christ (cf. 2Cor 5:10).24
       So Joe next turned to Mt 7:20-23 and asked me about that passage.
No surprise there. These are the favorite proveitistic proof-texts. What did
surprise me, however, was that he then asked me if I thought Tim Tebow
was saved. I responded that I did. Joe challenged my accepting Tebow’s
testimony as being genuine because, in Joe’s opinion, Tebow was not
Christlike enough to go to heaven. Joe disapproved of some of the TV
commercials that Tebow produced and thereby concluded that Tebow is not
a Christian. Joe maintains that to be a Christian means to be Christlike.

23
   After all, Matthew confirms that entrance into the kingdom is conditioned on
believing (Mt 21:31-32). Believing is not conditioned on entrance!
24
   Their born-again status is confirmed, for example, in Jam 1:17-18, where their
new birth is pictured as a gift from above. Yet they were in danger of facing a
merciless judgment (Jam 2:13) if they did not perform works of mercy. This
type of salvation is conditioned on performance (i.e., works). Naturally,
believers are justified by works within this passage because judgment is always
according to works. The problem is that Calvinists think that this salvation by
works is referring to salvation from hell. Therefore, they condition salvation
from hell on works. As an aside, note that believing in God does not constitute
saving faith (Jam 2:19). Even Calvinists believe in God and tremble, but this
does not prove that they are saved. Demons and unregenerate Calvinists believe
in God, but they do not believe in Jesus for eternal life.
Page 20                                         New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
Since Tebow is not Christlike (enough to suit Joe), Tebow is not a Christian
and therefore lost, on his way to hell (according to Joe). From Joe’s
perspective, Tebow is not Christlike enough to go to heaven.
                  Illustration 7. Are You Christlike Enough?




        I pointed out to Joe that some of those within the kingdom camp
would agree with him that to be a Christian means to be Christlike. Wilkin,
for example, argues that not all regenerate NT believers are Christians in the
NT sense of the word. Wilkin’s argument is plausible and has interesting
implications. For Wilkin, Christian would refer to a full-fledged follower of
Christ. Calling someone a carnal Christian would be a misnomer. He would
refer to them as carnal believers instead. Some other kingdom speakers take
the same point of view.
        In contrast I prefer to use the term Christian in a more popular sense
as referring to a born-again believer in Christ. Therefore, I would allow the
usage of the term carnal Christian, at least in today’s language. For
kingdom advocates, the difference is, to some degree, a matter of semantics,
though I do find the implications that Wilkin draws regarding King Agrippa
in Acts 26:28 to be very intriguing. Was Agrippa a silent believer
contemplating becoming a public follower? Not all regenerate NT believers
were confessing Christ publicly (Jn 12:42-43). Perhaps Agrippa was letting
Paul know that he was a believer making such a contemplation. For the
believer, being Christlike is important because rewards within heaven are
granted according to how Christlike we are. Not perishing in terms of
salvation from hell, however, is conditioned solely on believing in Christ,
not on how well or publicly you follow Christ.
        For Joe, though, the issue of being Christlike is a matter of heaven
versus hell. For Calvinists, confessing Christ is a condition for reaching
heaven (supposedly Mt 10:32-33).25 Getting into heaven is conditioned, in

25
   As Christ testified the good confession, so we likewise must testify if we are
to be Christlike (1Tim 6:13). This point is not the matter of dispute; rather, the
Marrowists Versus Calvinists                                           Page 21
Joe’s opinion, on being Christlike. Evidently, Joe considers himself
Christlike enough to go to heaven. When Joe asked me if I thought Tebow
was a believer, I had no problem responding positively. However, had Joe
asked me about my assessment of his own status, I would have had to
respond with considerable misgivings about Joe’s regenerate status. Jesus
was not giving the diagnostic within Mt 7:20-23 in order to approve a
Pharisaical spirit of self-righteousness within His followers. Far from it
(Lk 18:9-14)! One does not get to heaven by being a good Joe.
        The Pharisees of Jesus’ day considered themselves to be good God-
followers. The proveitists of our day likewise consider themselves to be
good Jesus-followers. Scripture tells a different story, however. Some
proveitists will respond to Jesus, as above, by pointing to miracles that they
have performed in Jesus name. Matthew proves that this is a proveitistic
error. Conversely, some proveitists will point to miracles that Jesus has
performed for them as proof that they have believed savingly. John
demonstrates that this is an error also.
        Just because Jesus performs a miracle for you, and you believe that
He has done so, this does not prove that you have believed savingly
(Jn 4:50-53). The Lord does many good things for people, even for
unbelievers (Mt 5:45). Yet this does not prove that they are believers. The
proper response to the Lord’s goodness is to trust in Him for eternal life.
Indeed, the Lord’s miracles were intended to lead people to trust in Him for
eternal life (Jn 4:50-53; cf. Jn 20:30-31). Trusting in the miracles themselves
for eternal life is wrong though. For example, the Lord does not intend for us
to trust in the moral transformations He might perform in our lives as the
basis for our assurance of having eternal life. We dare not trust in our earthly
lives for eternal life. Yet this error is prevalent in our day.
        To illustrate Jesus’ point, as it would be expressed in today’s
contemporary language, those of a Calvinistic orientation might respond
along these lines: “Lord, Lord, did we not teach DVD series in your name,
and in your name pastor churches, and in your name become missionaries.”
The same result potentially awaits them: “And then I will declare to them, ‘I
never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness.” Proveitists
are performatists, and basing one’s assurance on one’s performance is
fraught with peril.26

issue in contention between Marrowists and Calvinists is whether being
Christlike in terms of one’s performance is required to enter heaven. Marrowists
condition entrance into heaven on faith alone in Christ alone, not on being
Christlike. For Marrowists, rewards within heaven (rather than entrance into
heaven) are at stake for professing and following Christ.

       Testimony
        Basing one’s assurance on one’s performance is completely
unnecessary, however. During a church picnic when this missionary and I
had lunch together a couple of months earlier, we had discussed some
aspects of Calvinism. On that occasion also, she wanted to hear my
testimony. The answer I gave was, “My testimony is that I believe in Jesus
Christ for eternal life; therefore, I am going to heaven.” She did not like that
answer, so she asked for my testimony again, with an emphasis on the word
testimony. I restated it this way: “I testify that I believe in Jesus Christ for
eternal life; therefore, I am going to heaven.”
        Naturally, she did not like that answer either. Nor are these the
answers I have been trained to give in the various evangelism classes I have
taken over the years. Such evangelistic courses train you to share your
testimony in terms of experiences: the impact, changes, and results that
Christ has made in your life.
        Granted, I have those and used to share those as part of my testimony.
But I have become wary of calling these my testimony in discussions
regarding assurance of salvation. Even the unregenerate can testify to life-
changing experiences because of their encounters with Christ. (Even
Calvinists would acknowledge this to be true!) A changed earthly life
because of an encounter with Christ is no proof that one has received eternal
life from Christ. Many people are trusting in Christ for various things and
experiencing modifications in the way they live as a result and consequently
fooling themselves into thinking that they have had a born-again experience.
I pity them. They are basing their assurance of reaching heaven on their
earthly performance.
        Many years ago I kicked the habit of basing my assurance, even in
part, on my performance. This addictive habit is a poor substitute for the real
thing—biblical assurance. My assurance nowadays is based exclusively on
Christ’s promise, not on my performance. As to assurance, my testimony is
that I no longer trust in what many would call my testimony (i.e., my life’s
story of the impact Christ has had upon my life) for eternal life.
              Illustration 8. Faith-Based Syllogism of Assurance
       1. Jesus promised eternal life to those who believe in Him for
          eternal life.
       2. I believe in Jesus for eternal life.
       3. Therefore, I have eternal life.
Marrowists Versus Calvinists                                                Page 23
        I trust directly and exclusively in Christ alone for eternal life.27 I do
not trust in my earthly life for eternal life. My testimony is that I no longer
trust in my so-called testimony for eternal life. Technically expressed, my
dynamic experience of eternal life is not the source to which I look for the
assurance of my static possession of eternal life.28 Stated more simply, for
my assurance of reaching heaven, I look to what Christ has done for me on
the cross and to the promises He has made to me in Scripture rather than to
what Christ is doing through me or to the promises I make to Him.

       Faith Plus
       In fairness to Ferguson, however, let me point out that he provided a
better answer than this missionary who based her assurance on her love for
Christ. Ferguson said that faith is the first sign of having been born again.
Aside from my dislike of his calling faith a sign (and thus a result) of having
been born again rather than a condition for being born again, I do appreciate
the fact that he based assurance on faith—or at least tried to give the
impression of doing so.
       Besides erroneously considering faith a result of rather than condition
for new birth, additional problems with Ferguson’s position may be noted.
First, he only allowed that faith is the first result, rather than a sufficient
result. The implication of his presentation was that faith must be
accompanied by a transformed life in order to be genuine. This is typical of
Calvinists.
27
   Some Marrowists would question using a faith-based syllogism for assurance.
They would contend that trusting directly in Christ for eternal life does not
require such a reflexive deduction. Calvin argued for a direct approach, but his
views regarding temporary faith and perseverance precluded him from
consistently maintaining a direct affirmation of assurance as being logically
consistent with his position. His followers, consequently, adopted faith-fruit
based practical syllogism as their means for relative assurance. By rejecting
Calvin’s views on temporary faith and perseverance, some leading modern-day
Marrowists believe that Calvin’s preference for the direct approach can be
salvaged; therefore, they reject syllogistically derived assurance. See Dillow,
Final Destiny, chs. 29-30, for example. Other Marrowists, such as myself, find
the practical faith-based syllogism useful. See my Dad, can I be sure I am
saved? Both sets of Marrowists would unite, however, in rejecting the faith-fruit
based syllogism. Thus Marrowists of either persuasion would derive absolute
assurance as the logical result of looking to Christ for eternal life. Indeed, these
two Marrowistic approaches need not be considered mutually exclusive. One
might believe directly initially and reflexively subsequently.
28
   Ironically, Calvinists trust in their dynamic experience of eternal life for their
assurance of having saving faith. They trust in eternal life for faith. Oppositely, I
trust in Christ for eternal life.
Page 24                                          New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
            Illustration 9. Faith-Fruit Based Syllogistic Assurance
        1. Those who believe and have the fruits of regeneration are
           probably saved.
        2. I have believed and have some possible fruits of regeneration.
        3. Therefore, I am probably saved.

        This Calvinist approach to assurance will reduce to faith plus works
as necessary to get into heaven, which is the logical outcome of the
Calvinistic system. Bear good fruit in terms of your performance or burn in
hell would be their mistaken impression of Mt 7:19.29 “Bear or burn!” would
be the Calvinistic mantra. In counterpoint, Marrowists believe that entrance
into heaven is conditioned on faith alone in Christ alone.
        Second, given Ferguson’s Calvinistic premise regarding election,
surely he would take a Calvinistic position regarding perseverance,
according to which perseverance in faith (and faithfulness) would be
necessary to reach heaven. But perseverance in faith is a performance
issue. The Lord rewards us for persevering in faith. To condition entrance
into heaven on perseverance is to make heaven a reward.30 Accordingly, the
Marrowistic question is not, “Are you persevering in the faith?” but “Have
you ever come to faith alone in Christ alone for eternal life?” Those trusting
in their persevering faith are trusting in their performance instead of Christ.
        Loving Jesus, keeping His commandments, and persevering in faith
are performance issues—things for which the Bible promises rewards if you
are a believer. However, trying to work one’s way to heaven by means of
Calvinistic performance does not qualify one for being considered a NT
believer. A worker, maybe; a believer, no.
        Third, the Bible teaches that we can know that we have eternal life.
Calvinism reduces assurance to speaking in terms of probabilities.
Marrowism, in contrast, stresses absolute assurance as being the logically
consistent outcome of its theological perspective. Absolute assurance is the
birthright of everyone who believes in Christ for eternal life. But Calvinists
are not always forthcoming with the implications of their theology,
especially regarding assurance.

Christianity.
30
   Soft-shelled Marrowists would allow that entrance into heaven is conditioned
on God’s preservation of the believer’s faith rather than on the cooperative
perseverance of the believer in his or her faith. Although as a hard-core securitist
I disagree with this soft-shelled perspective, it does fall within the permissible
scope of Marrowistic possibilities. See my 3D Unconditional Security.

       Chameleon
        White overstates his case when he says, “While unregenerate men
may know the facts of the gospel, they have no desire to believe in the
Lord Jesus Christ and cast themselves solely upon him?”31 If this
statement were a true statement of White’s theology, then one could
conclude that when anyone has the mere desire to believe in Jesus for eternal
life, that person is regenerate, even if he or she has not yet believed!
Supposedly, if you desire to be saved, then you could know that you are
regenerate. Aside from the fact that his theology necessitated him to
overstate his case, let us allow him to weaken his statement, for the sake of
argument, to an affirmation he makes elsewhere regarding Jn 3:16.
According to White,

      anyone familiar with the text as it was written [in the original
      Greek] knows that the literal rendering of the passage is “in
      order that everyone believing in him should not perish but have
      eternal life.” The verse teaches that the giving of the Son
      guarantees the salvation of all the believing ones.32

      As already noted, in contrast to Hunt, I have no problem with White’s
statement, at least as to how it is actually written.33 Rather, my problem with
what White has written is that he conceals the true nature of his position
with this statement. The statement, as it is written, is an expression of
Marrowism, not Calvinism.

       Marrowism
       A Marrowistic evangelistic conclusion would allow that anyone and
everyone who believes in Christ alone for eternal life may put their name in
either of the following blanks, if they so wish, and have complete assurance
that Jesus’ promise to whoever/everyone who believes certainly includes
them:
              Illustration 10. Marrowistic Whoever = Everyone

             “For God so loved the world, that He gave His one
             and only Son, that ___________________ believes in
                                       whoever
             Him will not perish, but have eternal life” (Jn 3:16; TM).

              “For God so loved the world, that He gave His one
              and only Son, that ___________________ believes in
                                      everyone who
              Him will not perish, but have eternal life” (Jn 3:16; TM).


       While White’s translation of the verse is fully permissible
grammatically, his statement about the verse conceals a terrible, theological,
Calvinistic inconsistency. Within Calvinism, entering the kingdom of
heaven (i.e., entering heaven) is conditioned upon persevering. Temporarily
believing in Jesus guarantees you nothing but a hotter place in hell. You
might temporarily desire to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and cast
yourself solely upon Him. But if you only believe temporarily, then this
temporary faith only guarantees you damnation. As one may anticipate, this
Calvinistic doctrine severely undermines any firm sense of assurance.
       Calvin is not shy about the implications of his doctrine regarding the
temporary faith of the nonelect:

               Hence it is not strange, that by the Apostle a taste of
       heavenly gifts, and by Christ himself a temporary faith, is
       ascribed to them. Not that they truly perceive the power of
       spiritual grace and the sure light of faith; but the Lord, the
       better to convict them, and leave them without excuse,
       instills into their minds such a sense of his goodness as can be
       felt without the Spirit of adoption.34

Why is White so sly about this Calvinistic doctrine? Is he trying to conceal
the darker side of Calvinism—temporary faith? What Calvinism is this that
White describes for us when he purposefully avoids mentioning the
Calvinistic doctrine of temporary faith within his book and writes therein as
if temporary faith is not a problem for Calvinism?
       According to Calvin, the temporary faith of the nonelect is placed
within them by the Lord so that He can have even better grounds for
condemning them for not having a genuine faith, which He refused to give
them! In his interpretation of the parable of the soils, Calvin ascribes God’s

deception to “a secret movement of the Spirit.” Ferguson failed to mention
this Calvinistic deception on the part of the Holy Spirit when he described
the ministry of the Holy Spirit from the Calvinistic perspective. How is it
that Ferguson and White act as though Jn 3:16 gives assurance to all those
who believe its promise when, according to their own theology, it provides
no assurance to those who temporarily believe its promise?
                     Illustration 11. Nonelect Believers?




        According to the Calvinistic doctrine of election, and all the baggage
that goes with it, God, by the power of His Holy Spirit, irresistibly causes
the nonelect temporarily to believe in order that He might use passages such
as Jn 3:16 to deceive them into thinking they are genuine believers. He does
so in order that He might be better excused for condemning them for not
continuing to believe. In other words, God temporarily causes them to
believe so that He can then turn around and condemn them for their
apostasy.
        This is the heritage that Calvinists have inherited from their great,
great, theological grandfather—Calvin. Perhaps Calvin was not so great. He
certainly had his theological warts. And he undoubtedly paints an ugly
picture of God in which God is pictured with such theological warts.
        When some people learn of this deception by the Calvinistic God,
they turn away in apostasy. After all, who would want to worship such a
God? Seemingly, at times, Calvinism itself is a contributing cause to
apostasy. It is hard for people to keep believing in a God who deceives
people into believing in Him once they find out about the deception.
        Many Calvinists are able to keep the Calvinistic faith, to be sure. But
one must wonder if such faith is saving faith, even when it is kept, when the
God pictured by Calvinism is found biblically not even to exist. Why should

I believe that Calvinists and Marrowists worship the same God?36 I do not
fear the Calvinistic God, for I do not believe he even exists. The God of the
Bible is a God who does not use Jn 3:16 deceptively. For present purposes, I
simply will rest my case on God’s honesty.37 God cannot lie (Tit 1:2).38
       Marrowists, unlike Calvinists, actually believe that God guarantees
the salvation of all the believing ones. Yes, all of them, even the ones who
believe temporarily. To use White’s words, all those who believe in the Lord
Jesus Christ [for eternal life] and cast themselves solely upon Him may rest
assured that God has not deceived them.39 Marrowists actually believe what
White has written when he says that everyone who believes in Christ alone
for eternal life is assured of having that life. Does he? Marrowists can know
for certain that they are saved eternally because they can know for sure that
they have eternal life. Such is the heritage of Marrowism. In Marrowism,
you can trust God when He promises you eternal life.

verse underscores that what God has promised is eternal life. The Arminian
claim, that God temporarily gives you eternal life and then takes it away from
you if you believe temporarily, necessarily involves their ascribing a certain
degree of deception to God, yet not so much as in Calvinism which compounds
the problem by grounding this supposed deception in unconditional election.
Because Marrowism affirms unconditional security, it stands dynamically
opposed to both Arminianism and Calvinism, since both of these schools of
thought teach conditional security. According to Marrowism, the life God gives
you the very moment you first believe is eternal life and therefore cannot be
conditioned on eternal faith.
39
   Within Marrowism, God is not the one to blame when those who think they
believe in Him actually believe in their perseverance instead of believing solely
in Jesus for eternal life. Nor is God to blame when those who claim to believe in
Jesus for eternal life actually believe in Him for something less, such as
temporary life or contingent life. Believing in Christ for temporary life does not
qualify as believing in Christ for eternal life. God has not promised salvation to
those who believe in Jesus for probation.

       The heritage of Calvinists, in strong contrast, is one of doubt and
deception. How can Calvinists know for sure that they are elect when they
worship a God who routinely deceives those who seek to follow Him into
thinking they are elect? Granted, some Calvinists attempt to write like
Marrowists in order to make Calvinism more appealing for those who
simply judge according to appearances. But for those who look beneath the
surface, that is, who judge righteously, the complete incompatibilism
between the two schools of thought will become very apparent.

      My Problem
       When the Calvinistic missionary said that her inability to provide a
coherent explanation for her position was my problem, I was flabbergasted.
She tried to sound like a Marrowist when she quoted 2Pet 3:9 so as to give
the impression that God does not desire for any to perish in hell. Yet when I
called her bluff, by asking how she would reconcile that impression with her
interpretation of Jn 3:16, in which her Calvinism makes it quite clear that
God is very willing for most to perish, all she could say was that this was my
problem.
       Not surprisingly, I suppose, I chose to go to a different church that
next Sunday. I have a friend who teaches a Marrowistic Sunday School in a
city nearby. Even though it is about a fifty-minute drive, it was worth it to
escape the insanity I had heard the Sunday morning before. During that drive
though, it occurred to me that she was right, from a certain point of view.
Her inconsistency was my problem, not hers.
       A couple of analogies came to mind. Hitler had no problem killing
Jews. If you had a problem with his killing Jews, then that was your
problem, not his. Abortionists have no problem killing babies. If you have a
problem with their killing babies, then that is your problem, not theirs.
Calvinists have no problem with inconsistencies within their theology or
with doing a character assassination on God’s character. If you have a
Page 30                                         New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
problem with their teaching inconsistencies or maligning God’s character,
then that is your problem, not theirs.
        Okay, so I was able to see, from her perspective I suppose, how her
holding to a theology that attacks God’s character is my problem, not hers. If
she teaches a false gospel, then that is my problem, not hers. She evidently
has no problem defending a gospel that stands Jn 3:16 on its head and turns
it into a lie for many people. Alright, I can see how that is my problem. I can
also see above that when I say, “My problem with what White has written is
that he conceals the true nature of his position with this statement,” I am
admitting that I am the one who has a problem with what White has written.
He obviously has no problem with it. I acknowledged that his acting like a
chameleon was “my problem.” The same is true of this missionary.
        When she acted like God not wanting anyone to perish was consistent
with her theology and then had this inconsistency pointed out to her, she
responded by saying, in effect, that my problem with her inconsistency was
my problem, not hers. She had no problem believing contradictory things.
Her acting like a theological chameleon was my problem, not hers.
        From that perspective, then, I can understand how this Calvinistic
missionary could say that her inconsistency was my problem. It took a week,
but I got it during that drive. White could retort, for example, “If you have a
problem with what I have written, then that is your problem, not mine.” This
missionary likewise could respond, “If you have a problem with my acting
like a chameleon, then that is your problem, not mine.”
        True perhaps. But can I not make it their problem by persisting in
pointing out the problems within their positions? Persistency will be
necessary, I am sure, because when I pointed out the inconsistency of the
Calvinistic position to those Calvinists that Sunday morning, they turned a
deaf ear. So I write this book, and others like it, to provide that persistency
in hopes that their inconsistency eventually will be perceived to be their
problem also. Is pointing out the reptilian nature of their inconsistency
biblical?40 Certainly.

40
   I call it reptilian because, like the chameleon, it tries to look like its
surroundings. In one text, it will display colors of concern for everyone. In other
texts, it will change its colors to show that this concern was not a genuine
expression of its nature. The Bible would consider this reptilian behavior a form
of hypocrisy. As if that were not bad enough, this cold-blooded theology then
has the audacity to portray God as being a cold-blooded monster who condemns
individuals to hell without giving them any chance of being saved. If certain
cults are regarded as such because they consider Jesus a god and make salvation
from eternal damnation conditioned on works, should we not consider
Calvinism as possibly falling into a similar cultic category? One cult distorts the
nature of the Son; the other cult the nature of the Father. Both cults teach
salvation by works.

       Your Problem
        In Scripture I read of an occasion when one person had a problem
with someone else’s theological inconsistency. Specifically, Paul had a
problem with Peter’s “hypocrisy” in not being “straightforward about the
truth of the gospel” (Gal 2:11-14). Paul had a problem with Peter’s
hypocrisy. From the Calvinistic point of view expressed that Sunday
morning by the missionary, I suppose we could say that it was Paul’s
problem, not Peter’s. Poor Paul. If Paul had an experience like I did that
Sunday, and he may have, then someone might have told him during that
episode, “That’s your problem, Paul.” Perhaps, they would have added
something to the equivalent of our, “Get over it.” Maybe someone in the
church tried to calm Paul down with comments such as these and wanted
Paul to get over his problem.
        Obviously, Peter had no problem with his own hypocrisy. Many
others within the church had no problem with Peter’s hypocrisy either. In
fact, many of them were swept away by it and joined Peter in his hypocrisy!
If not refuted, hypocrisy is contagious.
        Yet here is the rub. Paul turned it around. Paul opposed Peter to his
face, in the presence of all, because Peter stood condemned. Wow! Ouch!
Paul turned his problem into Peter’s problem. Paul shared his problem with
Peter—in front of everybody! Paul made his problem Peter’s problem.
However you want to say it, Paul did not sit quietly by and let Peter get
away with not getting the gospel right. Paul rebuked Peter, publically, to his
face. To put it in our vernacular, Paul got in Peter’s face. Not rudely or
crudely, to be sure, but he did rebuke Peter for not being consistent with the
implications of his theological convictions. To sit quietly by, while brother
Peter distorted the truth of the gospel, was not something Paul was willing to
do, no matter how many people in the church supported Peter. How about
you?
        Are you going to just sit quietly while others in your church invert the
gospel? I was the only one in our church that morning who voiced an
objection to the perversion of the gospel that occurred. Even if you have to
act alone when facing a prestigious Peter in your church who is abusing the
gospel, do it! Earlier in that same chapter, when facing “false brethren” who
were perverting the gospel, Paul told his readers that he “did not yield in
subjection to them for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel might
remain with” his readers (Gal 2:4-5). In the same manner, I did not sit
quietly by for an hour but voiced my objection, within that Sunday School
hour, at the end of the Sunday School period, when it was opened to
discussion. What are you going to do when this happens in your church? The
clock is ticking. Is your hour about up?
        To that Calvinist that morning, her Calvinism was my problem, not
hers. But I write this book with the intent of making it a problem for those
Calvinists who, like herself, consider their Calvinism a problem for others
Page 32                                       New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
rather than for themselves. Just like Paul did with Peter, I will make my
problem their problem, even face to face, when given the opportunity.
       Hitler had no problem killing Jews. Yet those who had a problem
with his doing so rose up and made it a problem for him. Abortionists have
no problem killing babies. Yet pro-lifers make doing so a problem for
abortionists. Do pro-lifers get criticized for objecting? Of course they do.
They are called unloving bullies, for example. Undoubtedly, you likewise
will be criticized if you oppose Calvinism. Expect it.
       I wonder if Paul got criticized for rebuking Peter. I can just hear it
now, “Brother Paul, you should not rebuke such an esteemed fellow believer
in such a public, forthright manner. You should be more loving and tolerant,
more Christlike.”
       Someone has a defective understanding of what it means to be
Christlike, though, when they forget that Christ called Peter, Satan, in the
presence of the other disciples, when Peter, with good intentions, tried to get
in the way of Christ fulfilling His gospel mission. Strongly rebuking
someone to their face is not necessarily acting in an unloving or un-
Christlike manner. To the contrary, not defending the true nature of God’s
love is unloving and un-Christlike. If you love God, should you not defend
His character against those who malign it? If someone insulted your wife,
would you quietly sit there while they did so? I hope not! Then why do you
sit by quietly when Calvinists insult the loving nature of God? Hunt does
well to ask Calvinists, “What love is this?” when they misconstrue the nature
of God’s love. Hunt’s example is worthy of imitating.
       If your love for God is not enough to enable you to speak up for God,
then how about speaking up because Christ told you to love your enemies?
Would not love for the enemies of the gospel of Christ require that you
rebuke them when they distort the gospel? Is not allowing someone to go
unchallenged in their error a very unloving thing to do, especially
considering the calamitous results that will befall them because of their error
(Eze 3:18-19)? One reason we should rebuke them is because it is the loving
thing to do. Let us not be squeamish about pointing out the full ramifications
of their error.

       Conclusion
       Calvinists present a false caricature of God as not genuinely loving
the entire world in the manner described in Jn 3:16, paint a false picture of
Jesus as not truly loving all the little children, teach a false gospel that
conditions salvation from hell on works, and portray God as a moral monster
who seeks to deceive the nonelect into thinking that they are genuine
believers when, in fact, He never intended to make it possible for them to
become genuine believers. Distorting the nature of the gospel can have a
devastating impact on our understanding of the nature of God. As a
Marrowist, I have a problem with such distortions. If you genuinely have a
Marrowists Versus Calvinists                                          Page 33
problem with such issues, I hope that you will join Paul in rebuking those
who present such a distorted picture of the gospel and that you will not be
intimidated by the claim that doing so is unloving.
       Classical Calvinists go so far as to say that Jesus did not die for
everyone. After all, why bother to die for them if He is not going to make
salvation possible for them? Other Calvinists will allow that Jesus did die for
everyone but will still maintain that He did not make it possible for them to
be saved in that He has made it impossible for them to believe savingly.
“What kind of love is this?” is truly an appropriate question when such love
portrays Jesus as saying, “I love you enough to pay for your sins but not
enough to make it possible for you to accept the payment.” In either case,
when Jn 3:16 is taken holistically, Calvinists picture God as limiting the
saving intent of His love to those whom He unconditionally elects for
salvation. For Calvinists, God’s loving intention to make salvation possible
to those who believe is conditioned upon His election. His love within this
verse is conditional, not unconditional. He loves the elect in the manner
described in Jn 3:16, not the nonelect. He did not elect to love the nonelect
so as to make salvation possible for them in the manner described in this
verse.
       Within Calvinism, if their God wants your name in the following
blank, then He will put your name in it; you have no choice in the matter. Or
perhaps one more accurately might say that if the Calvinistic God wanted
your name in the following blank, then He would have put your name in it
from the foundation of the world; you had no choice in the matter and never
will.

             “For God so loved the elect, that He gave His one and
             only Son, that ___________________ will not perish,
                             whoever God elects
             but have eternal life and consequently believe in Him”
             (Jn 3:16; TM).

       So if I were a Calvinist, I would have to tell you that you cannot put
your name in that blank. You cannot be sure that God loves you in the
manner described in this verse. A Calvinist cannot truly look a person in the
eye and tell them that God loves them in the manner depicted in Jn 3:16. For
Calvinists do not know if the people whom they meet are elect, so they
cannot assure them that God loves them so much as to give His Son so as to
make eternal life possible for them.
       Thankfully, I am not a Calvinist. Therefore, I can assure you that God
loves you in the manner described in Jn 3:16. Jesus not only gave His
(physical) life for you, He is willing and able to give His (eternal) life to
you.
Page 34                                        New Birth by the Sovereign Wind

       Invitation
        If you believe that whoever believes in Jesus for eternal life is given
that life by God, then I invite you to put your name in the following blank as
a simple expression of that belief as being personally applicable to you. It is
up to you. By legitimately making you this offer, God has made it possible
for you to believe in Jesus for eternal life. But by giving you the opportunity
and ability to do so, He has placed the responsibility for your doing so in
your lap.41 What are you going to do about it?

             “For God so loved the world, that He gave His one
             and only Son, that ___________________ believes in
                                      whoever
             Him will not perish, but have eternal life” (Jn 3:16; TM).




41
   If you are a Calvinist, though, you cannot put your name in this Marrowist
blank since you do not believe the verse as stated. Marrowistically, of
course, I can assure you that God loves you just like He does everyone else
in the manner stated in the biblical rendition of the verse. But since you do
not believe His promise, as He has stated it, you will have to follow the
Calvinistic protocol of looking elsewhere than this verse in your quest for
assurance. Yet I warn you: To disbelieve Jesus’ promise, as He has given it
in this verse, is to make yourself a disbeliever.
                 Excursus:
         Calvinists and Marrowists
                             Classical Calvinism
        Calvinism is a branch of conditional security which teaches that God
sovereignly determines (i.e., elects) who will persevere and thus will make it
to heaven. Divine election is the basis for human perseverance. The
sovereignty of God is emphasized. The elect persevere because they are
unconditionally predetermined by God to persevere so that they might reach
heaven. Calvinists sometimes like to present themselves as advocates of
unconditional security, but Calvinism actually is a failed attempt to enjoin
unconditional security with conditional security. The Calvinist might assert
that the believer is unconditionally assured of reaching heaven, but what a
Calvinist actually means with such an articulation is that the believer is
unconditionally assured of persevering, thereby reaching heaven. In
Calvinism, reaching heaven is conditioned on the believer’s perseverance.
Calvinism is summarized by the acronym TULIP:
• Total Depravity—means total inability. Man is totally unable to believe
     the gospel unless God acts upon him with irresistible grace in
     regeneration. Regeneration, at least in its incipient form, must precede
     belief. God regenerates man so that man may believe in accordance with
     his new nature.
• Unconditional Election—means that God unconditionally elects who
     will believe and be saved. Man is not elected because he believes.
     Rather, he believes because he is elected. God predetermines who will
     believe and be saved. It was never God’s intention to save the nonelect.
     Election is selection. God pre-selects who will believe and causes them
     to believe. No one else genuinely can believe the gospel. No one else
     will persevere in saving faith. No one else can be saved.
• Limited Atonement—means that the benefits of the atonement are
     extended only to the elect. In summary, Christ died only for the elect,
     not for the nonelect. God limited the available benefits of Christ’s death
     to the elect. God never had any true intention of making salvation
     possible for everyone.
• Irresistible Grace—means that God irresistibly causes the elect to
     become regenerate so that the elect will believe. Regeneration,
     therefore, precedes faith. Faith is a gift from God that the elect do not
     have the power to refuse.
• Perseverance of the Saints—means that saints who persevere are
     preserved and thus saved, in the end, as a result of their perseverance.
     Only those who persevere are preserved. Preservation does not apply to
     those who do not persevere. Thus, perseverance of the saints is not to be
Page 36                                     New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
    confused with eternal security of the saints. Only the elect persevere,
    and they persevere because they are predestined to persevere. Yet they
    must persevere in order to reach heaven. From the perspective of
    unconditional election, this model teaches OSAS (once saved always
    saved). However, from the perspective of conditionality, this model
    teaches NOSAS (not once saved always saved). This form of NOSAS
    affirms that one hypothetically may lose one’s regeneration and cease
    to be saved if one does not persevere.

                          Contemporary Marrowism
        Marrowism is the present author’s coined term for describing his
mediating non-Calvinistic Free Grace theology, which is positioned between
Arminianism (PEARS) and Calvinism (TULIP) and summarized herein by
the author’s acronym GRAPE. Historically, this movement was expressed in
seminal form by the Marrow Controversy. In a number of key areas, the
present author may be considered a modern-day Marrowist. The present
book is an introduction to Marrowism as the present author has come to
refine and define it. The author’s fuller explanation is detailed in his book,
The Outer Darkness. As used by the author, Marrowism refers to a defense
of unconditional security consisting of soteriological and misthological
consistency. Marrowism is summarized by the acronym GRAPE:
• Gift is Free—means that the gift of eternal life is offered as a free gift
     and must be passively received as such.
• Rewards are Earned—means that the distinction between unmerited
     gifts and merited rewards must not be blurred.
• Absolute Assurance—means that personal assurance of one’s salvation
     from eternal damnation is the essence of saving faith.
• Passive Persuasion—means that faith is a passive persuasion, not an
     active commitment.
• Eternal Security——means that the person who trusts in Christ alone
     for eternal life immediately and eternally thereafter has eternal life and
     cannot experience eternal damnation. This doctrine of eternal security is
     known popularly as OSAS (once saved always saved) and is
     consistently and emphatically affirmed by GRAPE, in contrast to the
     conditional denunciation this doctrine receives in TULIP and PEARS.
     The affirmation of eternal security (E) is placed strategically at the end
     of the GRAPE acronym in order to contrast the most distinctive aspect
     of Marrowistic theology from the other two acronyms. Unlike
     Arminianism and Calvinism, Marrowism emphatically does not
     condition salvation from hell on the believer’s perseverance. GRAPE
     affirms true eternal security, not some Arminian or Calvinistic imitation
     of security. Marrowistic eternal security is unconditional security.
                 Excursus:
     Calvinistic Selection for Election
        Whom does God elect for salvation within the Calvinistic system?
Whomever He wishes. For all apparent purposes, it is a very simple
selection process. He chooses to save some, and He chooses not to save
others. His selection is based on His selection. Granted, Calvinists may like
to talk about the mysterious inner workings of God’s inscrutable will, but for
those standing on the outside looking at what is going on, as described by
Calvinists, there is a genuine simplicity.
                       Illustration 13. Calvinistic Election




        The Calvinistic theory reminds me of what I have heard about slot
machines. I have never played one myself; in fact I don’t gamble at all, but
my understanding is that slot machines can be calibrated on the inside to
affect one’s chances of winning, as long as the odds remain within the legal
limit.42 As a former math major, I could find reading about the mathematics
involved somewhat interesting I suppose. But given my lack of interest in
gambling, I do not find the prospect of trying to understand the inner
workings of the slot machine very appealing. While a slot machine repair

42
   Even though calibrated to generate random results through mathematical
algorithms, the results must still conform within legal limits. The internal chip is
able to determine the average odds for the long term. Playing slot machines is
highly addictive for some people. Personally, I do not participate in any form of
gambling, not even in the Calvinistic version in the theological arena. Both
forms can be highly destructive.
Page 38                                      New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
technician or casino owner might be able to explain how slot machines work
on the inside, to me it is somewhat of a mystery.
       Similarly, I have an interest in theology; therefore, seeking to
understand the inner workings of Calvinistic election holds some interest for
me. However, a Calvinist might be able to explain those inner workings of
their Calvinistic system better than I can. Then again, perhaps not. If the
inner workings of God’s will in election is as inscrutable as Calvinists claim,
then why think that Calvinists can explain those inner workings either.
Would not the only one capable of explaining the inner workings of the
Calvinistic selection mechanism be the Calvinistic God Himself? To speak
analogously, would Calvinists not be left standing outside the magic box like
the rest of us and only peering at what appears to be completely, randomly
generated results?
       According to the Calvinistic theory, God selects to save the elect. His
selection is not based on anything they have done. Rather, it is based simply
on the inner workings of God’s inscrutable will. Whosoever will is really
whosoever God has chosen to make willing. If God selects you, seemingly at
random (from all apparent purposes), then you are elected to go to heaven.43
His selection has nothing to do about you really; it is all about Him. To the
glory of His sovereign grace, He chooses to save a few. They had no choice
otherwise, and those whom He did not chose had no choice otherwise either.

43
   The Calvinistic God just as easily could have chosen to have Gabriel to rebel
rather than Lucifer and to have Peter betray Christ rather than Judas. For some
reason, unexplainable in the Calvinistic model, He chose some particular angels
and humans to be elect. This selection was not merely cooperate but also
individualistic. He wrote down the names of these elect humans before the
foundation of the world in the Book of Life (Rev 13:8; 17:8). Supposedly,
within Calvinistic thought, His selection for who would believe (and have
eternal life) was made independently of their believing. That is, God did not
select them because they believe. Rather, they believe because God selected
them. He sealed their fate as to whom He would elect independently of anything
they would do.
       The Marrowistic model I pose, however, is that God foreknew who would
believe and wrote their names down in the Book of Life because they believe in
Christ for eternal life. See my discussion in The Outer Darkness. That He could
do so is not the true mystery. Two popular models are entertained in my book as
plausible. Rather, the mystery is how He did so—the mechanics involved, if we
may call it that, by which He foresaw future and potential future events. Posing
middle knowledge is, at most, only a probable component of part of the answer.
God did not look through a time telescope, nor did He foresee the future by
stepping or existing outside of time. I would pose that rather than looking
without, He looked within (i.e., within His own creative potential) to see what
would transpire if He took certain courses of action.
Calvinistic Selection for Election                                    Page 39
He chooses not to save most people. So if you are one of the lucky ones
whom God has chosen, then good for you. You have won the divine lottery.
If you are one of the unlucky ones (i.e., the nonelect), then sorry, you just
didn’t win. Regardless as to whatever mystery Calvinists might theorize
regarding the inner workings, the outer result is easy to understand. There is
no mystery there, only what appears to be nothing more than random luck.
        Marrowism, in opposition to Calvinism, is opposed to advocating a
theology that would result in picturing God as some sort of divine slot
machine in the sky. The model posed herein is that God foreknows who will
believe and has predetermined that those who believe will go to heaven.
Like the Calvinist, I find the inner workings of election very interesting. For
that reason, I spent over 100 pages discussing it in one of my chapters in The
Outer Darkness. Still, there are some things I do not understand. After all,
the Bible does say, “His understanding is inscrutable” (Is 40:28). “How
unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!” (Rom 11:33)
On the other hand, I am quite confident from what He has chosen to reveal
about Himself, that He has chosen to save whoever believes and has made it
possible for whoever hears Jn 3:16 to believe it. I am not left standing on the
outside of some mysterious slot machine hoping that I got lucky and won the
divine lottery. God has not calibrated the verse so as to limit His love to the
elect. This has a profound impact on one’s assurance of God’s love.
                         Illustration 14. Daisy Theology




       The TULIP doctrine of assurance really amounts to what Wilkin
would call daisy theology: “You go through your whole life with what I call
daisy theology. ‘He loves me, He loves me not. He loves me, He loves me
not.’ And you hope you end your life on ‘He loves me’ cause you don’t
Page 40                                     New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
       44
know.” This was well expressed in a GES comic strip series by Mike
Sanderson.45
        The GRAPE doctrine of assurance, in sharp contrast, affirms that
personal assurance of one’s salvation from eternal damnation is the very
essence of saving faith. If you believe in Christ for eternal life, then you
have eternal life in Christ, and you believe (i.e., know) that you have eternal
life in Christ. To be a believer means that you believe that you have eternal
life in Christ. Assurance is the essence of what it means to be a believer.
Therefore, my testimony, as I told that missionary, is that I believe in Jesus
Christ for eternal life; therefore, I am going to heaven. No slot machine. No
random selection. Just absolute assurance.
        Although I have some theories about predestination that I discuss in
The Outer Darkness, I do not fully know how God was able to know in
advance that I would believe and thus how He was able to write my name in
the Book of Life from the foundation of the world. But I do know that He
did. Such knowledge is assumed in the NT. Believers can know that their
names are in the Book of Life (Phil 4:3). I know my name is in that book.
No guesswork is necessary, or even reasonable, about that aspect of God’s
selection. You can have that assurance too, if you believe Jn 3:16 and not
some Calvinistic distortion of it.

                Excursus:
         The Duality of Eternal Life
        Unfortunately, Joe had a simplistic view of eternal life that hindered
him from seeing how Tebow might have such life. However, as is widely
recognized, eternal life has two dimensions: quality and quantity. Biblically,
it speaks of (1) a quality of life (e.g., having life abundantly), and, of course,
this life is (2) quantitative in that it goes on forever; that is, it is eternal.
        As soon as you believe in Christ for eternal life, you are granted that
life as a free gift and thereby unconditionally assured of entering heaven.
Your qualitative experience of eternal life cannot dip below the gift
threshold that assures you of entering heaven. However, how richly you will
experience eternal life is dependent upon you subsequently following Christ.
This experience is subject to dynamic variation. Reaping eternal life as a
future reward is even pictured by the Bible as receiving this life as a crown.
If Tebow has performed well in his service for Christ, he will hear the words
that we all want to hear when we stand before Christ, “Well done.”
        On the other hand, if he (or any other believer for that matter)
engages in activities of which Christ would disapprove, then he risks not
hearing the words, “Well done.” The Lord even teaches that some believers
will receive a rebuke rather than a commendation. The crown of eternal life
is at stake in such an evaluation; the gift of eternal life, however, is not in
jeopardy.
           Illustration 15. Unconditional Security and Eternal Life




      The gift range of eternal life, which guarantees you entrance into
heaven, is and remains a gift throughout eternity. The gift of eternal life does
not become a reward. The gift of eternal life is yours to keep eternally.
Page 44                                       New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
Consequently, entrance into heaven and residency therein is offered to you
as a free gift. All you have to do in order to receive the gift of eternal life is
to believe in Jesus for eternal life. Such is the message of Jn 3:16.
        On the other hand, although the biblical message of eternal life may
start with Jn 3:16, it by no means stops there. Freely receiving the gift of
eternal life puts you in a position where you are now qualified to run for the
prize, the reward aspect of eternal life. To find out more about these aspects
of eternal life, my other books may be consulted. I explain this and other
related diagrams in far greater detail therein.
                              Excursus:
                             Believe to See
     Unless one is       born again,         he cannot    see     the kingdom of God (Jn 3:3).
     Unless one is born of water and Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God (Jn 3:5).

         Interpreting the reference to being born of water and Spirit in Jn 3:5
is problematic. Most likely, this water-birth described in Jn 3:5 does not
refer to physical birth (female or male water); rather, it refers to spiritual
birth. The impartation of spiritual life by the Spirit is likened to water in
Jn 3:5 and wind in Jn 3:8. The imagery being employed uses water/rain from
above to depict spiritual sperm. In this analogy, spiritual birth requires a
spiritual Father who spiritually begets His children with spiritual semen.
This spiritual birth is the requirement to enter into the kingdom.46 The nature
of this entrance is interpreted variously, as is the parallel expression in
Jn 3:3: see the kingdom. Not all of these interpretations are mutually
exclusive. In fact, an integrated perspective can be beneficial and shed light
on what it means to enter the kingdom.
        To see the kingdom from an insider’s perspective, naturally you must first
enter the kingdom by faith (Jn 3:3,5). This insider knowledge comes from faith.
By faith we understand (Heb 11:3). This type of knowledge comes from faith.
We believe in order to know and understand (Jn 10:38; cp. 1Cor 2:14).
Nevertheless, a rudimentary, preliminary understanding is necessary for saving
faith to occur (Mt 13:19; cp. Lk 8:12; Rom 10:17). In Jn 3:1-16, the basic order
is: believe → birth/life → enter/see. Possibly, this sequence might be expanded
to a more precise equation: believe £ (birth → life) £ (enter → see).
        Historically, one may pose that faith comes first. Augustine exhorted:
“Believe so that you may understand.” Following the same perspective, Anselm,
said, “I believe so that I may understand.” They made this rationalization in
order to express the relationship between faith and reason. In discussing this
Augustine-Anselm perspective, Clark explains: “In temporal sequence,
faith...precedes full understanding, for one first accepts basic Christian truth on
divine authority. At the same time, in order to exercise faith, a person must
understand the words that minimally explain the gospel.”47 In other words, the
sequence is: (1) minimal understanding of the saving-gospel message (that
promises eternal life to those who believe in Christ) followed by (2) saving faith
(in Christ for eternal life) allows (3) one to proceed to a full understanding of the
Christian message. Faith comes first. Entrance into a fuller kingdom perspective
requires that one first believes the basic kingdom message that eternal life is
granted to those who believe: believe → see/enter.

        Epistemologically, one might say that when one becomes a believer,
one’s paradigm changes radically, enabling one to see things from a different
frame of reference. Here again, the order is: believe → see/enter. As already
noted above in reference to deferred fuller understanding, placing faith before
sight is certainly not out of order biblically (cf. Rom 8:24-25). Writing as an
epistemologist, Clark explores these ramifications in paradigm shifts in some
detail. However, to adapt his discussion of the rabbit-duck illustration48 to the
present treatment, consider it from the following shift in perspective.
             Illustration 16. Are You a Rabbit or a Duck or Both?




        Imagine a conversation between two rabbit-ducks. The offer of eternal
life is available to both, but the unbelieving rabbit-duck thinks that the gospel is
only good for quacks. The believing rabbit-duck, on the other hand, has come to
believe that the gospel is applicable to any rabbit-duck who believes—and thus
is applicable to him or herself. A new orientation (or in the case of the
illustration, even a slight rotation in one’s perspective) can have a profound
impact on one’s perception of the gospel’s implications. Such changes in
perceptions are not merely psychological, however. Eternal life is metaphysical
and thus has tremendous eschatological implications.49

48
   Ibid., 150. As for those who do not hear the gospel, see Clark’s discussion of
middle knowledge on p. 321.
49
   Naturally, those pictured by rabbit-duck on the left cannot accept the gospel as
true without seeing it as applicable to themselves and thus having a change in
their perspective. Rabbit-ducks who think that they are only rabbits must come
to see themselves as ducks to whom the gospel applies.
        Constitutionally, as rabbit-ducks, they should be able to see that the
gospel is applicable to them as ducks. Nothing in their rabbit-duck makeup
prevents them from making such a deduction. Whatever may be preventing them
pragmatically from making this deduction has no impact on their constitutional
ability or the gospel’s availability. They can believe that Jesus genuinely offers
them life because He genuinely does so for all rabbit-ducks. They simply must
come to see themselves as rabbit-ducks, not merely as rabbits.
        As a result, when they believe, they metaphysically become simple-
ducks, and, some day, eschatologically, their physical appearance will manifest
that new nature externally, and they no longer will be mistaken for rabbits. But
that consideration is for mature ducks. So I will duck out from explaining it in
Believe to See                                                            Page 47
       Eschatologically, we must believe in order to see (i.e., enter) the future
kingdom. So if commentators such as Carson, Govett, Köstenberger, Michaels,
and Wilkin are correct that an eschatological usage of the kingdom is envisioned
in this verse, then, as Carson states: “The expression to ‘see the
kingdom’...means to ‘participate in the kingdom at the end of the age, to
experience eternal life, resurrection life.’”50 In such a case, you must believe
now so that you can see/experience/enter the kingdom then: believe → see/enter.
       Metaphorically, Jesus simply might be using see synonymously with
enter in Jn 3:3,5 so that see = enter.51 If so, the sequence still places believe
before see: believe → see/enter. But even if a complete metaphorical overlap
were not intended, so that one could pose a (limited) distinction between
entering and seeing, such as enter → see, one must still conclude that one enters
the kingdom by faith: believe £ enter → see.
       Metaphysically, we must believe in order to come/enter into possession of
eternal life. Consequently, entrance into the kingdom is conditioned on faith. As
Morris observes, “John frequently speaks of eternal life, and for him the
possession of eternal life appears to mean very much the same thing as entering
the kingdom.52 Hendriksen concurs: “When Jesus speaks of entering the
kingdom of God, it is clear that the expression is equivalent to having
everlasting life or being saved (cf. 3:16, 17).”53 Indeed, a comparison of
Mt 18:8-9 with its parallel in Mk 9:43-47 also shows that entering life and
entering the kingdom can be used synonymously.
       Since seeing/possessing/experiencing eternal life (even now) is a
consequence of believing and since this equates to entering/seeing/participating
in the kingdom (even in the present), entering the kingdom (even now in the
present) is a consequence of believing. Faith is most naturally understood to be
the condition for regeneration. Projecting a two-phased regeneration is most
unnatural.


this little booklet. There is no need to confuse the rabbits even more than they
already are.
        Even if a text such as 1Cor 2:14 might be applicable to describing the
inability of the rabbit-duck on the left (1) to make the minimal transition of
perceiving the saving offer of eternal life as true or (2) to make a more advanced
transition to the experiential perception of the truthfulness of fuller revelation,
we have every reason to believe that, in the proclamation of the rabbit-duck
gospel to rabbit-ducks, God makes it possible for all rabbit-ducks to come to
perceive the gospel as applicable to themselves as ducks. Their duck nature has
not been effaced and, therefore, constitutionally allows them to perceive the
gospel as applicable to themselves through the enabling grace of God’s gospel
call.

Page 48                                          New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
       This chapter in John’s gospel concludes by stipulating: “He who believes
in the Son has eternal life [even now]; but he who does not obey the Son shall
not see life [either now or in the future], but the wrath of God abides on him”
(Jn 3:36). To believe/obey (i.e., the obedience of faith) results in having/seeing
eternal life. The metaphysical sequence in each of these cases is: believe → see.
        The Calvinistic equation of see with believe, so that regeneration (i.e.,
new birth) must precede initial faith (i.e., believing savingly) is
counterintuitive to the context and refuted by those Calvinists who correctly
equate entering the kingdom with having eternal life. Since the latter is
conditioned on faith, so must be the former. Thus the sequence posed by
those Calvinists who advocate a two-phased regeneration (which places
initiatory faith after regeneration) is to be rejected. The order in this context
is not: birth → (initial) see/believe.54

       54
          The debate is not whether faith can be pictured as seeing. Of course it
can. Compare the implied looking/seeing in Jn 3:14 with the explicit invitations
to see in Jn 1:46; 4:29. But the implicit order in Jn 3:14 is: see/believe → live.
        Calvinists advocating a two-phased regeneration (in order to place the
first phase of regeneration before faith) might try to import the implied seeing
(and thus believing) from 3:14 into 3:3 so as to conclude: new birth (v. 3) →
see/believe (vv. 3,14) → enter kingdom/have eternal life (vv. 5,16). They might
then further state that new birth results in new sight. Supposedly, then, one must
be regenerate before one can have this new sight, that is, before one can
experience the saving faith that results in the possession of eternal life.
        This claim unnecessarily equates the stated seeing of v. 3 with the implied
seeing of v. 14, however. The seeing in the former is the result of new birth; the
seeing in the latter is the condition for new life. Obviously, one cannot have new
birth without experiencing new life. This new life is called eternal life and is
conditioned on faith. Thus verses 3 and 14 are not posing a two-phased
regeneration but, at most, a two-phased sight. The order is certainly not: new
birth (v. 3) → see/believe (v. 3) → enter kingdom (v. 5) → see/believe (v. 14)
→ have eternal life (v. 14). Nor is it: new birth / enter kingdom (v. 5) →
see/believe (v. 3,14) → have eternal life (v. 14).
        Rather, it is this: see/believe (v. 14) → have eternal life (v. 14) / new birth
(vv. 3,5) / enter (v. 5) / see (v. 3). If, as being allowed herein for the sake of
argument, the see in v. 3 potentially advances beyond having eternal life and
entering the kingdom to encompass a new perception, then this seeing is a fuller,
subsequent perception. To abbreviate the proposed order and arrange it in a
natural sequence, it would be: see (v. 14) → new birth/have life/enter → see
(v. 3). This is simply using see in place of believe in the original precise
equation proposed herein: believe £ (birth → life) £ (enter → see). This fuller
sight in v. 3 comes as a result of the initial sight in v. 14. This initial sight of v.
14 results in one coming into the possession of eternal life and thus entering the
kingdom, which, in turn, enables one to advance to the fuller sight of v. 3. The
implied seeing in v. 14 pictures a saving perceiving/understanding/believing.
Believe to See                                                                Page 49
       To conclude, since the impartation of spiritual life by the sovereign
Spirit is likened to water in Jn 3:5 and wind in Jn 3:8 and the former is
conditioned on faith, new birth by the sovereign wind must also be
understood to be conditioned on faith. Likewise, the new sight, spiritual
seeing, or paradigm shift that comes as a result of believing the gospel is a
new, but derivative, belief/perspective that is made possible by first
embracing the seminal message of eternal life by saving faith.55

        Jesus explains to Nicodemus what new birth is: It is having eternal life as
a result of believing. Believing is not the cause of having eternal life; rather, it is
the condition for eternal life, and thus for new birth. God is the one who causes
us to have eternal life on the condition that we believe in His Son for eternal life.
55
   Although Erickson is a Calvinist and is sorely tempted to place regeneration
before faith (because that is where his Calvinism logically locates it, as he
himself admits), nevertheless, to his credit he candidly admits that the biblical
evidence places faith before regeneration, so he concedes the point and
acknowledges that God regenerates believers as a result of their faith (p. 932).
Granted, he considers saving faith to be a gift from God (p. 941) and grounds it
in God’s “special calling” (p. 933). Nevertheless, even some Marrowists
likewise regard saving faith to be a gift and regard it to be a result of God’s
effectual calling. Personally, I am opposed to calling saving faith a gift.
Notwithstanding, as long as this effectual calling and so-called gift are not
limited to the elect in such a way as to make saving faith impossible for the
nonelect (due to some supposed unconditional election for example), allowances
may be made for those holding such perceptions to be considered Marrowists as
long as they do not make perseverance a condition for reaching heaven.
        After all, the original Marrowists came out of a Calvinistic background
and sought, through the aid of Amyraldianism (a mild form of Calvinism), to
return to Calvin’s original insistence that assurance was the essence of saving
faith. Therefore, the early Marrowists were still somewhat susceptible to some
of the same errors and inconsistencies found within Calvinism and
Amyraldianism. Indeed some of my criticisms made herein could be applied to
the early forms of Marrowism. For this early form of Marrowism, see Edward
Fisher’s The Marrow of Modern Divinity. While I am very appreciative of the
pioneering work of Fisher and other early Marrowists, modern Marrowists have
had opportunity to work out some of the bugs inherent within the early forms of
Marrowism—bugs that were inherent from their Calvinistic background. I have
done so in my book, The Outer Darkness. Other contemporary Marrowists have
come to similar, albeit slightly different, conclusions.
        For example, Dillow is a splendid modern Marrowistic writer who would
allow calling saving faith a gift in the sense of a passive response that occurs via
the Spirit’s enablement as a person contemplates the evidence: “His faith was
simply a response to the evidence the Holy Spirit enabled him to see clearly and
sympathetically” (p. 677). Yet Dillow would clarify, “Faith is not a ‘gift’ in
the...sense of God regenerating a man before he believes” (p. 677, n. 2224).
Page 50                                        New Birth by the Sovereign Wind


        Seeing the gospel as true and personally applicable to oneself can, from
Dillow’s Marrowistic perspective, be regarded as a gift that results in (not from)
regeneration, and this faith/seeing is not contingent on unconditional election.
Unlike the early Marrowists, but like myself, Dillow rejects all 5 points of
Calvinism (Destiny, 429, n. 1479); however, in contradistinction to myself, he
would regard saving faith to be a gift (in this sense of the word described above)
that is freely available to any who will contemplate the evidence. The primary
difference between us, at this point, is purely semantic in that he would allow
calling such faith a gift; whereas, I would not. Yet we both would regard it to be
a passive response that results from a sympathetic contemplation of the evidence
via the Spirit’s enablement.
        Despite the arguments herein, many Calvinists may insist on (1) placing
the first phase of regeneration before faith, (2) regarding faith as a gift, and
(3) limiting the extent of the atonement to the elect, since this is the paradigm to
which many Calvinists are accustomed. Even granting them such concessions,
however, need not be an insurmountable obstacle to their embracing the main
arguments herein. The offer in Jn 3:16 still may be understood as applying to
everyone who believes, and God need not be pictured as a slot machine.
        If one were to combine Fisher and Dillow’s perspectives with middle
knowledge, one could argue that God elects those who believe (cp. note 19). So
if you believe, you are elected. God foreknew who would believe in response to
looking to Christ sympathetically as a result of the Spirit’s enablement, and He
sent His Son to die for them. In the due course of time, when they do
sympathetically consider the evidence, God (irresistibly) gives them the gift of
faith as a result of their sympathetic looking to Christ. For God so loved the
entire world so as to make salvation possible to any who would believe, and He
has made believing possible to any who would believe via the Spirit’s enabling
when presented with the gospel message. He sovereignly, irresistibly, and
irrevocably regenerates those who respond sympathetically to this enabling
drawing. What, then, is the condition for regeneration? Looking to Christ
(Jn 3:14). Who determines if the call is effectual? You do. (See my
discussion in The Outer Darkness.) Both the (effective) extent of the atonement
and the effectiveness of the call are determined by your (foreseen) response.
        Although this is not the particular form of Marrowism that I hold in all its
particulars, it does approximate my position closely enough so that I can use
even this potential Marrowistic model to demonstrate that Calvinists would have
to defeat multiple strands of evidence within the present book in order to defeat
the main contentions herein. Namely, in Jn 3:16 God has made a genuine offer
to the entire world so that anyone who hears the message of Jn 3:16 can enter
their name in that whoever blank with complete confidence that they have
eternal life as a result of believing the message of that verse. In rejecting an
unconditional election that is based on a seemingly arbitrary selection and by
acknowledging that even temporary faith in Christ for eternal life is saving faith,
the blank created by Jn 3:16 is opened biblically to whoever ever believes.
                     Excursus:
           The Duality of Seeing/Entering
       For present purposes, it will suffice to point out an additional duality
to eternal life that may be intended by Jesus in this context. The duality
frequently noted by biblical interpreters, and already pictured in Illustration
15 (p. 43), pertains to the very nature of eternal life. Qualitatively, the
experience of that life is subject to wide fluctuation. Quantitatively, the
possession of that life is eternal. Arguably, the words see and enter might
point to a similar duality. Some interpreters say that seeing the kingdom in
Jn 3:3 is metaphorically equivalent to entering the kingdom in Jn 3:5. If so,
then there is no duality in the see-enter depiction. Yet an overlap rather than
mere equivalency might be intended.
                    Illustration 17. The See-Enter Overlap




       The historical and epistemological implications already discussed are
suggestive that a fuller dimension to seeing may be anticipated.
Contextually, one also would anticipate that more than a mere metaphysical
or eschatological entrance into the kingdom is being associated with the
word see. Nicodemous has just come to Jesus and said, “Rabbi, we know
that You have come from God as a teacher” (Jn 3:2). Nicodemus was a
highly esteemed Rabbi and thinks that he is paying Jesus a compliment by
giving Him this respectful greeting, “Rabbi.” Jesus responds by showing
Nicodemus that his understanding is woefully inadequate (Jn 3:10) in
comparison to those who truly know what they are talking about (Jn 3:11).
Therefore, a reasonable supposition is that Nicodemus does not see (in the
sense of understand) as clearly as he thinks he does (cp. Jn 9:39).
Page 52                                       New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
       Due to a variety of factors, then, the supposition may be granted that
see includes but is not limited to enter. A partially overlapping duality is
permissible. One might even pose that to see the kingdom might entail the
latent possibility of ruling therein. Nicodemus would anticipate more to the
possibility of entering the kingdom than just entering it by the skin of his
teeth. A seed for seeing the realization of the misthological56 implications of
the kingdom might, therefore, be intended with the word see.
             Illustration 18. The See-Enter Duality of Eternal life




        To enter into the kingdom may suggest a static dimension of eternal
life that is juxtaposed with the dynamic experience of seeing eternal life. In
this context, to enter the kingdom is completely static. At the moment in
time in which one metaphysically enters the kingdom by believing in Jesus
for eternal life, one’s internal nature is changed from a rabbit-duck to a
simple-duck, so to speak. Or expressed in biblical terms, one metaphysically
becomes a new creature in Christ (2Cor 5:17). By coming into the
possession of eternal life, one has entered into the kingdom metaphysically
and permanently. This soteric57 movement from death into life, with its
attendant security, is strongly affirmed in this biblical book (Jn 5:24; 10:28).

56
   Misthology is a coined term derived from the Greek words misthos (reward)
and logos (teaching) and refers to the doctrine of temporal and eternal rewards
but is used primarily in reference to eternal rewards. Mistholic is a synonym for
misthological and hence pertains to the biblical doctrine of rewards.
Misthologists are Marrowistic teachers who specialize in the doctrine of
rewards.
57
   Soteriology is based on two biblical Greek words, soteria (salvation) and
logos (teaching), and correspondingly refers to biblical teaching about salvation.
Although the biblical concept of salvation includes many dimensions other than
The Duality of Seeing/Entering                                           Page 53
        To see life is used also in this soteric capacity (Jn 3:36; cf. 1:46;
4:29). However, the foundation is laid within the Gospel of John to perceive
seeing as expanding58 beyond this simple soteriological possession to
encompass the dynamic experience of having eternal life abundantly59 so as
to include, what is described elsewhere as, seeing “the kingdom of God after
it has come with power” (Mk 9:1; cf. Lk 9:27; Jn 1:51).
           Illustration 19. The See-See/Enter Duality of Eternal life




       In other words, seeing the kingdom is used in a dual capacity.
Therefore, although within this current Johannine context entrance into the
kingdom should be understood as limited to the static soteric dimension of
eternal life, one may entertain the possibility that seeing the kingdom is
intended to move beyond this simple static soteric dimension, in terms of the
latent potential of seeing, to include, among other things, a mistholic
dynamic dimension as well.60

deliverance from hell, it is this aspect of salvation to which writers refer
frequently when they use the word soteriology. Soteric is a synonym for
soteriological and hence pertains to salvation from eternal damnation.
58
   Jn 1:34; 50-51; 3:11,22; 11:40; 12:41; 14:7,9; 20:20.
59
   Jn 10:10.
60
    Limiting enter to the soteric arena is consistent with my “Warning to
Misthologists” in The Outer Darkness (pp. 960-961). Nevertheless, allowing
that see may move beyond merely soteriologically entering the kingdom to
misthologically seeing/experiencing the regal possibilities within the kingdom
opens the dialogue for a neoclassical Marrowistic understanding of the passage.
In that case, enter is soteric; see is soteric-mistholic. Notwithstanding the fact
that Jn 3:19 may hint at manifesting one’s devotion to Christ by one’s works
(and that such works would qualify the believer for kingdom rulership), the
focus of John ch. 3 is certainly soteric rather than mistholic.
Page 54                                      New Birth by the Sovereign Wind
       Put in less technical terms, if a misthological dimension is entailed in
the seeing in Jn 3:3, then Jesus is indicating that the possibility of
seeing/experiencing the millennial kingship (i.e., ruling in the millennial
kingdom) requires (among other things) that one be born again (so that one
may enter the kingdom). For one cannot enter the kingship if one does not
enter the kingdom. Entering the millennial kingdom is a prerequisite to
ruling in the millennial kingdom.
             Illustration 20. The See-Enter Duality of Eternal life




       Nicodemus knew something about millennial rulership. He aspired to
such millennial prominence. Yet Jesus informed him that to realize such an
aspiration he would have to be born again. For unless he is born again, he
will not even enter the kingdom. Spatial entrance into the kingdom is a
prerequisite to seeing/realizing the kingdom rulership. You must be born
again so that you can enter the kingdom and be in the running to qualify for
kingdom rulership. You will never see/experience kingdom rulership if you
are not born again. So first things first.
